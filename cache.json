While in Kansas, Brown was involved in a\r\nnumber of skirmishes in the so-called  Bleeding Kansas&quot; era, including the &quot;battle&quot; of\r\nOsawatomie on August 30, 1856.  \r\n\r\n<p>The John Brown Cabin was built in 1855 by Samuel Glenn, who sold it to Samuel Adair, Brown's brother-in-law.  Brown frequented the cabin and occasionally used it as a headquarters for his abolitionist activities.  Built about a mile west of Osawatomie, the log cabin was dismantled and reassembled in its present location, John Brown Park, in 1912.  A stone pavilion was constructed around the cabin in 1928, however the interior of the cabin remains much as it was when Brown was a frequent visitor and contains much of the original furniture.  John Brown only lived in Kansas for about\r\n20 months, but his abolitionist activities leading up to his infamous raid on Harper's Ferry have\r\nbeen closely associated with the state.<p>\r\n\r\n<i>The Adair-John Brown Cabin is located at the <a href=\"http://www.kshs.org/places/johnbrown/index.htm\">Adair Cabin State Historic Site</a> in Osawatomie, Kansas.

Eventually, as the nation developed, tensions over the issue of slavery  would place Fort Scott at the center of Bleeding Kansas and ultimately the  Civil War. Today, Fort Scott National Historic Site stands as a witness to the history  of the conflicts between various cultural groups important in the American  story. When the United States broke its  promise to reserve the land west of the Mississippi for American Indians, the United  States Army recognized that its services to protect the Indian frontier were no  longer required and abandoned Fort Scott by 1853. </p>\r\n        <p>The debate in Kansas  over slavery turned into a violent affair that terrorized the State  for more than five years. &ldquo;Bleeding  Kansas&rdquo; offered a preview of what the nation would face in the Civil War. The town of Fort Scott divided over the issue  of slavery. Before the Army reinstated Fort Scott, settlers on both sides of  the issue gained control of the fort&rsquo;s vacant buildings. The abolitionists took  over the former officers&rsquo; quarters and named it the Free State Hotel, while on  the opposite side of town square, the proslavery headquarters was at the Western  Hotel, formerly the site of the old infantry barracks.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>During the Civil War, many freedom seekers sought the protection and   liberty provided by the United States Army. Fort Scott was one such safe   haven. As the main citadel protecting Kansas&rsquo; southern flank from   invasion, the militarized town served as a major Union Army supply   depot, general hospital, and recruitment and training center. From Fort   Scott, soldiers pressed the offensive into the neighboring   Trans-Mississippi. Wagons returned with the sick and wounded as well as   with refugees and freedom seekers hoping to find sanctuary. Although   life at Fort Scott proved difficult for lack of basic necessities,   thousands displaced by war found the town to be a critical, if   temporary, respite \r\nalong their journey to freedom. \r\n </p>\r\n<table width=\"250\" border=\"0\" align=\"right\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><img src=\"graphics/FOSC_NPSphoto.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"166\"></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><h5>Park guide Lacy Walden leads a school program for fifth graders with VIP Susan Anderson  assisting.\u00c2\u00a0 <br>\r\n      Credit: NPS Photo from Fort Scott NHS</h5></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>Kansas was  the first State to recruit and train American Indians and African Americans to  serve in the Union army. Many able bodied free and formerly enslaved African American men were   recruited at Fort Scott to form elements of the First and Second Kansas   Colored Volunteer Infantry regiments. These soldiers acquitted   themselves well in the face of the enemy, with the First Kansas Colored   Volunteer Infantry being the first African American unit to serve in   combat, at Island Mound, near Butler, Missouri, in October 1862. The   First and Second Kansas Colored Volunteer Infantries were federalized   and reorganized as the 79th and 83rd United States Colored Troops,   respectively. At least one formerly enslaved African American woman served as a nurse at the US Army General   Hospital at Fort Scott; she later received a U.S. government pension   for her Civil War service. Fort Scott is also known <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  On the eve of the Emancipation Proclamation taking effect (January 1,   1863), William Matthews, an African American businessman, conductor on   the Underground Railroad, and military recruiting officer from   Leavenworth, Kansas, participated in celebratory festivities at Fort   Scott. Besides helping organize earlier African American units, in 1864   Matthews recruited many men at Fort Scott for the First Regiment, Kansas   Colored State Militia. Matthews was one of roughly 125 known African   American commissioned military officers to serve in the Union Army   during the Civil War. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  In 1865 the Freedmen&rsquo;s Bureau established a school for African Americans   just north of the current historic site grounds. Fort Scott&rsquo;s first   public school for African Americans opened in 1872 in the former post   hospital (Fort Scott National Historic Site&rsquo;s visitor center); it&rsquo;s most   famous student was future humanitarian and inventor extraordinaire, the   formerly enslaved George Washington Carver. </p>\r\n<table width=\"250\" border=\"0\" align=\"left\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><img src=\"graphics/FOSC2_NPSphoto.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"165\"></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><h5>Visitors to the site descend the stairs of one of the Officers' Quarters along Officers Row while autumn leaves add a splash of color to the scene. <br>\r\n      Credit: NPS Photo from Fort Scott NHS</h5></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>At Fort Scott National Historic  Site, visitors can see 20 historic structures, a parade ground and five acres  of restored tallgrass prairie.

Gaston, a  Congregationalist missionary and Reverend John Todd, a graduate of Oberlin  Theological Seminary in Ohio.\u00a0 Gaston and  Todd sought to create a frontier colony in the image of Oberlin Seminary.\u00a0 They were both adamantly opposed to  slavery.\u00a0 </p>\r\n<p>As the United States  expanded westward, the important question of whether or not slavery would also  be extended to the new territories was confronted by settlers.\u00a0 The passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act in  1854 pitted &quot;free-soilers,&quot;-- those who advocated free  states--against supporters of Popular Sovereignty, who promoted the right to  bring slaves into a territory. Framed against the nationwide conflict over the  spread of slavery, Kansas was the battleground for the forces of liberty and  bondage, and &quot;Bleeding Kansas&quot; was born. Iowa became an important  route for free-soilers entering Kansas, as well as the nearest free state to  those escaping slavery in Missouri.</p>\r\n<p>Gaston was  instrumental in propagating antislavery practices in western Iowa.\u00a0 Referred to as the town\u0092s founder for his  activities in creating a settlement in the early 1850s, Gaston was first drawn  to Iowa because of a missionary trip to the western prairie.\u00a0 Gaston and his wife Maria Cummings worked among  the Pawnee Indians in Nebraska from 1837 to 1842.\u00a0 They were both quite changed by the people  they met.\u00a0 Forced to return to Oberlin  due to health issues, Gaston had a difficult time forgetting the experiences he  had.\u00a0 He strongly believed that a new settlement  in the western prairies could extend the good work of Oberlin in the frontier,  establishing a community firmly rooted in the values of religion and  education.\u00a0 Gaston, after much debate,  convinced a young Todd to join in the \u0093frontier colony adventure.\u0094\u00a0 Todd later proved to be crucial in  establishing the Underground Railroad in Iowa and helped make the town known, as declared by  George Gill, an associate of John Brown, as &quot;the staging point for the  free-state movement in Western Iowa.&quot;\u00a0\u00a0 </p>\r\n<p>Central to the  activities of Gaston and Rev. Todd were two prominent properties that are  included in the Tabor Antislavery Historic District: the Public Square (known  today as Tabor City Park) and the Reverend John Todd House.\u00a0 The Public Square (Tabor City Park), ten  acres of land once owned by Gaston and given to Tabor upon the town\u0092s official  establishment, was as an important community gathering space, serving as an  anchor for both the first buildings in the town and for the spread of  antislavery convictions.\u00a0 Townspeople met  in the square to discuss and reinforce their controversial, yet strongly held  beliefs in opposition to the \u0093flagrant sin\u0094 of slavery.\u00a0 As a result, they developed strong networks  of resistance to slavery and assistance to fugitive slaves.\u00a0 The square was also used for camping and  drilling exercises executed by local militiamen and by abolitionist John Brown  before his raid on Harper\u0092s Ferry.\u00a0 The  square reflects Gaston\u0092s educational and religious vision of the community in  the significant location the Public Square occupies in Gaston\u0092s original town  layout from 1854.\u00a0 One important building  still standing today facing the Public Square is Rev. Todd\u0092s House.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </p>\r\n<p>Todd's house, a  two-story, clapboard home built in 1853, was an established Underground  Railroad stop and perhaps the most significant &quot;hub&quot; on the  Underground Railroad in Western Iowa.\u00a0  John Brown himself came through Tabor on many occasions, including  during his escape after his celebrated &quot;invasion of Missouri.&quot; On  this occasion, 14 slaves were rescued, though one slaveholder was killed. Todd  decried the violence but still provided aid to the escapees during their  northward trek. The basement of the Todd House was also used to store arms  later used in Brown's violent raid on the federal arsenal at <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/underground/wv2.htm_\">Harper's  Ferry, Virginia</a>, though Todd had no knowledge of Brown's apocalyptic plans.</p>\r\nTodd  continued to build upon Gaston\u0092s antislavery rhetoric after the official  establishment of Tabor and recruited abolitionist Congregationalist ministers,  such as <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/underground/ia2.htm_\">George B. Hitchcock</a> of nearby Lewis, Iowa, to  come to the Great Plains to aid in the struggle.\u00a0 Many of Todd's sermons focused on slavery's  evils, often using sentiments expressed in the Declaration of Independence to  address the paradox of slavery in a &quot;free&quot; society.\u00a0 Todd served as a chaplain in the Union Army in 1864 and was instrumental in  building progressive Tabor College, founded in 1866 and open to all students  regardless of race or gender. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n <P>\r\n<I>The Tabor Antislavery Historic District is bordered by West, Center, Orange, and Elm Streets in Tabor, Iowa.  The Public Square (Tabor City Park) composes a majority of the historic district.  The Todd House is located in the historic district on Park Street and is open to the public by appointment.

Hitchcock in Lewis, Iowa was a welcome respite for runaway\r\nslaves and abolitionists who traveled through the state.  A minister of the Congregational Church,\r\nHitchcock was an ardent abolitionist and an agent for the Underground Railroad.  Born in\r\nMassachusetts in 1812, Hitchcock became a student of ministry, and in 1844 was ordained a\r\nminister in the Congregational Church.  He worked as a traveling \"circuit\" preacher in the frontier\r\ncountry of western Iowa following his ordination.  Settling in Lewis in the mid-1850s, Hitchcock\r\nbuilt a log cabin where he lived until the completion of his stone house around 1856.  From this\r\nhouse, Hitchcock carried out his Underground Railroad activities, providing shelter to fugitive\r\nslaves on their way northward.  In 1865, Hitchcock was called by the Congregationalist Church to\r\nwork in Missouri, where he was given the opportunity to educate and minister freed blacks.  Two\r\nyears later he moved to Kansas to carry similar duties in that frontier area.  An ardent abolitionist \r\nvirtually his entire adult life, George B. Hitchcock died in 1872 in Kansas.  His home in\r\nIowa stands as a testament to his role in the antislavery movement and his involvement in the\r\nUnderground Railroad.\r\n<P><I>The George B. Hitchcock House is located 1and 1/2 miles west of Lewis, Iowa, on Nishna Valley Road, south of U.S. Hwy. 6.  It is open for tours from May-September, from 1:00pm-5:00pm, closed Mondays.

Henderson Lewelling, a Quaker from Indiana, moved to Salem in\r\n1837 with his brother and opened a general merchandise store and established a small\r\ncommercial nursery.  Like other Quaker Meetings across the country, the Salem Monthly\r\nMeeting experienced a schism within in its membership over the action the community should\r\ntake in opposing slavery.  The Society of Friends opposed slavery, but some members felt that\r\nthey should not participate in helping fugitive slaves to freedom.  Lewelling represented the more\r\nactive side of this decisive question and in 1843, along with other members of the Salem\r\nMonthly Meeting, established the Abolition Friends Monthly Meeting.  By 1845, Salem Meeting\r\nhad disowned 50 of its members, an indication of how divided the Society of Friends was over\r\nparticipation in the Underground Railroad.  Some of the Abolition Friends most probably met in\r\nthe Lewelling House, built c.1840, to discuss their Underground Railroad activities, and the\r\nhouse may have also been a haven to fugitive slaves.  Salem was only 25 miles from Missouri, a slave state, and many of its residents had strong anti-slavery beliefs, making the town an active stop on the Underground Railroad.\r\n\r\n<p>Lewelling is also known for promoting the fruit industry in Iowa and later in Oregon and\r\nCalifornia.  He and his brother were the first people to plant fruit trees in Iowa.  In 1837 they\r\nplanted 35 varieties of apples, pears, cherries, peaches, plums, and small fruits.  Ten years after\r\narriving in Salem, Lewelling moved to Oregon and established a new nursery with 350 plants\r\nthat had survived the long journey--the first grafted nursery stock planted on the Pacific Coast. \r\nLewelling's brother later joined him and was responsible for propagating the Bing cherry.  In\r\n1853, taking advantage of the Gold Rush, Lewelling moved to California, established a nursery\r\nand founded the community of Fruitvale.  Today, Lewelling is known as the Father of the Pacific\r\nFruit Industry.

He began raising and selling livestock and later turned his attention \r\n        to real estate and promoting railroad development. Jordan was director \r\n        of the State Bank branch in Des Moines and in 1854 was elected to the \r\n        Iowa Senate, representing Valley Junction (now West Des Moines).

The unusual grout (lime mixed with coarse gravel and sand) house with its hexagonal three-story tower served as a local inn and the Goodrich family residence. Joseph Goodrich (1800-1867) was born in Massachusetts to a family active in the Seventh Day Baptist Church, a denomination that officially denounced slavery in several resolutions. As an adolescent, Goodrich moved to New York and in 1821 married Nancy Maxon. In 1838, he organized a party of fellow Seventh Day Baptists who traveled westward to Wisconsin to file a claim for unsettled land. The group built a log cabin and surveyed the land for the town that would become Milton. The town, located near the Rock River, a tributary of the Mississippi River, may have been on a route for fugitive slaves escaping to the communities along Lake Michigan that bordered Canada. Goodrich's family moved to Wisconsin the following year and the town soon began to grow. Goodrich added on to the log cabin and built on a frame structure that became the first Milton House Hotel. Prominent Milton citizens, Goodrich and his wife were leaders in the Seventh Day Baptist Church and in local community activities such as the DuLac Academy (later named Milton College), which Joseph Goodrich founded in 1844. A new Milton House Hotel, the building that stands today, was constructed in 1845, with an addition completed in 1868. A part of the original cabin complex remains as outbuildings. \r\n\r\n<p>Evidence of the Goodrich family's involvement in the Underground Railroad is substantiated by\r\noral testimony, letters, and published biographical material. An early statement of Joseph\r\nGoodrich's involvement in the movement is in <i>The United States Biographical Dictionary\r\nand Portrait Gallery of Eminent and Self-Made Men: Wisconsin Volume</i>, published in 1877\r\nwhich states, &quot;His home was a refuge for the fugitive slave.&quot;  According to oral tradition,\r\nfugitive slaves would enter the log cabin located approximately 10 feet from the rear of the Milton\r\nHouse Inn, in order to avoid guests.  They would then enter a trap door and walk through a\r\ntunnel that lead to the basement of the inn where Goodrich and his family provided shelter and\r\nfood.  The tunnel, originally an earthen structure about three to five feet high, is believed to have\r\nbeen constructed around 1845 when the house was completed.  In 1954, the property was\r\nremodeled to accommodate visitors and the tunnel was enlarged and lined with stone. <i>The\r\nWisconsin State Journal</i> wrote of Goodrich after his death in 1867, &quot;He was an\r\nuncompromising friend and advocate of the cause of temperance, and of human rights.  The poor\r\nand oppressed were received by him as a legacy of the Lord...&quot;\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<i> The Milton House is located at 18 South Janesville Street in Milton, Wisconsin.

Born in Maine, Lovejoy moved to Princeton in 1838 where he was \r\n        a minister for a Congregationalist Church. Only one year before, Lovejoy \r\n        had witnessed the shooting death of his brother Elijah, an abolitionist \r\n        newspaper publisher, by an angry proslavery mob in Alton, Illinois. Even \r\n        more committed to the cause after his brother's death, Lovejoy used the \r\n        pulpit to further the abolitionist cause and believed that slavery could \r\n        be abolished through political action. After two unsuccessful attempts \r\n        at running for the U.S. House of Representatives in the 1840s, Lovejoy \r\n        was elected to the House in 1856 where he gained a reputation for his \r\n        fiery antislavery speeches. During the 1840s and 1850s, Lovejoy also used \r\n        his home to harbor slaves on their way north and faced prosecution several \r\n        times. It was widely known in Illinois that Lovejoy was &quot;in charge&quot; \r\n        at Princeton and that fugitives passing through Princeton from slavery \r\n        to freedom were riding the &quot;Lovejoy Line.&quot; He was quite proud \r\n        of his opportunities to help slaves flee to freedom and admitted this \r\n        publicly, not as a boast, but to defy the supporters of slavery. In an \r\n        1859 speech in Congress that drew national attention Lovejoy addressed \r\n        his role in the Underground Railroad directly with, &quot;Owen Lovejoy...aids \r\n        every fugitive that comes to his door and asks it. Proclaim it then from \r\n        the housetops.

A Scottish born immigrant, Hossack came to Ottawa from Chicago, where he had done contract work on the Illinois and Michigan Canal.  In Ottawa, Hossack was engaged in the lumber business and grain trade, and instrumental in the building of the first Illinois River Bridge.  Overlooking this river, his home today is one of the city's finest.  Its natural setting and classic Greek Revival architecture alone make the house one of Illinois's outstanding landmarks.\r\n        <p>\r\n\r\nThe house is equally significant for its role in the Underground Railroad.  Hossack was a strong opponent to slavery and hid as many as 13 fleeing slaves in this house until they could safely reach the next station.  These escaped slaves were in constant danger of discovery and being returned to their owners, while Hossack and others in Illinois, if caught, faced greater jeopardy than abolitionists in other states.  By participating in the Underground Railroad, Hossack was violating not only the Federal Fugitive Slave Act, but also the infamous Illinois \"Black Law,\" which forbade most African Americans from living within the State.  In 1860, Hossack was one of several Ottawans charged and convicted in Federal Court in Chicago for violating the Fugitive Slave Law.

Eells built only the front portion of the house as it stands today,  four blocks from the Mississippi River. He lived here until  his death in 1848. Quincy, Illinois, was the first Underground Railroad station across the border of Missouri&#8212;a slave state. An abolitionist, Eells was actively involved in the Underground Railroad. In 1842  he was caught  helping an escaped slave, Charley, from Monticello, Missouri.   Charley was brought to the Eells house by a freed black, Barryman Barnett, who had spotted Charley swimming across the Mississippi River. While transporting Charley to Quincy's Mission Institute, a safer hiding place, Eells came across  a posse looking for Charley. Charley fled, on Eells's advice, and was later found and returned to Missiouri. Eells returned home where he was shortly arrested and  charged with harboring and secreting a fugitive slave under the Illinois Criminal Code.  Judge Stephen A. Douglas heard the case in April 1843, and fined Eells $400, which he appealed. </p>\r\n        <p>Meanwhile, Eells became president of the Illinois Anti-Slavery Party in 1843 and  was a candidate for the Liberty Party for the presidential election of 1844. He lost his appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court, the process of which drained him financially and emotionally. Eells  died on a river boat on the Ohio River while on a a trip east to rest. His estate appealed his case to  United States Supreme Court, which also upheld the guilt verdict.\r\n     The town of Quincy is also notable as the location of the sixth Lincoln-Douglas debate of their senatorial campaign \r\n    \r\n\r\n     on October 13, 1858, a debate which centered on the question of expansion of slavery. </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n\r\n<i>The Dr. Richard Eells House is located at \r\n\r\n\r\n 415 Jersey St.\r\n\r\n in Quincy, Illinois.

Before the Civil War, Illinois College was a center for the antislavery movement in the state. Beecher Hall, the original building of Illinois College, is the oldest college building in the state.  Construction of the south half, the original portion of the present two-story brick structure, began in the summer of 1829 and was completed in 1830. The design of the multipurpose building suggests the Late Georgian style of New England.  It was named for the college's first president, Dr. Edward Beecher, brother of the abolitionist preacher Henry Ward Beecher and the author of Uncle Tom's Cabin, Harriet Beecher Stowe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Illinois College had close ties with the abolitionist movement and the Underground Railroad from its inception. Its classrooms and residential quarters provided safe places to deplore slavery, strategize means for ending slavery, and to assist freedom seekers passing through Jacksonville. The college was founded by local trustees and seven graduates of the Yale Theological Department - all opposed to slavery. Its first college president Beecher and two college trustees helped found the Illinois Antislavery Society in 1837. Many of the early settlers in the surrounding area, however, had come from the Border States and were pro-slavery. Newspapers of nearby cities wrote scathing attacks on the college and its staff. Despite this hostile environment's effect on enrollment and funds, the college staff and many of the students they influenced upheld antislavery principles. A few went as far as assisting freedom seekers on the Underground Railroad. Some were arrested, and all suffered threats and harassment. Professor Jonathan Baldwin Turner, publisher of the abolitionist newspaper The Illinois Statesman, helped guide three fleeing African American women to safe haven enabling them to  eventually reach freedom in Canada. Samuel Willard, an Illinois College student, was prosecuted and fined for attempting to free an escaping bondsman. Elijah Lovejoy, the editor of the first abolitionist newspaper in Illinois, was a friend of President Beecher and visited campus. After the murder of Elijah Lovejoy at the hands of an angry mob in 1837, students held a protest on campus. One student speaker was William Herndon, later Lincoln\u00e2\u0080\u0099s law partner for twenty years. Not happy with abolitionist influences, Herndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father forced him to withdraw from the college.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Beecher Hall, Illinois College, is located at 1101 W.

He is notable for his association with the Matson  Trial of 1847, the only known case in which Abraham Lincoln, then a circuit  rider, defended a slave owner. In 1840 Dr. Hiram Rutherford had come to  Illinois from Pennsylvania where he studied medicine at Jefferson College and  grew up in an abolitionist family. Dr.  Hiram Rutherford built his two-story frame house off the square in Oakland in  1847, and his one-room office in 1850. His first wife also came from  Pennsylvania after he was established, and his second he met during the Matson  Trial.</p>\r\n <p>General Robert Matson, a Kentucky plantation slave  owner, kept a farm in the Oakland area. Each spring Matson would bring some of  his enslaved laborers to work his Illinois farm and then take them back to  Kentucky in the fall after the crops were harvested. One enslaved worker, Anthony Bryant, stayed on the  Illinois farm year-round, acting as overseer, acquiring his freedom this way.  In 1847 his wife Jane and four of her children were among those brought to work  on Matson's Illinois farm.  When Bryant  heard rumors of the intended sale of his wife and family on their return to  Kentucky, the family fled Matson's farm in the middle of the night. They sheltered at Gideon Ashmore's hotel with Ashmore and Dr. Hiram Rutherford's  connivance. When Matson returned to Illinois, he demanded that Rutherford and  Ashmore release the family. Instead the Justice of the Peace ordered the wife and children be removed to the jail in Charleston  in accordance with the law. Ashmore then applied to the Circuit Court for the  release of the family on a writ of Habeas Corpus.</p>\r\n <p>Matson  retaliated, filing a suit in Circuit Court against Ashmore and Rutherford, asking for $2500 from them for having taken his human \"property\" and causing  him damages. Matson claimed that the family were not Illinois residents and  therefore not entitled to their freedom. Rutherford and Ashmore argued that the  African Americans were not property of Matson, since the Illinois Constitution  of 1818 declared slavery illegal. When the trial was scheduled in Charleston,  Matson hired Usher Linder and Abraham Lincoln to represent him. Rutherford had  asked his friend Lincoln to consider representing him instead of Matson, but  Lincoln refused the offer saying that he was already committed to Matson.  Rutherford and Ashmore then employed Charles Constable and Orlando Ficklin.</p>\r\n <p>The  crucial question in the case was whether the Bryant family was held in transit  while crossing Illinois or whether they were held in the state by Matson. The  case was settled in October 1847 in favor of the Bryants. Well-wishers provided  the Bryants passage to Africa. In 1848 an American church elder found them in  Monrovia, Liberia. They begged him to pay their passage back to escape untenable  conditions in Africa but he could not oblige.</p>\r\n <em>The Dr. Hiram  Rutherford House is located at Pike St. and Illinois Route 133,  Oakland,&nbsp;Illinois.

Born in <a href=\"oh4.htm\">Mt. Pleasant, Ohio</a>, a Quaker town well-known for the antislavery activities of its residents, Dr. Nathan Thomas (1803-1887) settled in Schoolcraft around 1833. In 1835, he constructed a building that served as both an office and residence.  Five years later he enlarged the house when he married Pamela Brown of nearby Prairie Ronde township.  Pamela Brown Thomas' memoirs, written in 1892, provide much information on her and her husband's Underground Railroad activities.  Referring to Dr. Thomas' early days in Schoolcraft, before their marriage and the construction of his office and residence in 1835, Mrs. Thomas wrote, \"His antislavery views were so well known, that, while he was a bachelor boarding at the hotel, fugitives from slavery had called on him for assistance and protection.\"  Pamela Brown Thomas estimated that between 1840 and 1860 she and her husband helped between 1,000 to 1,500 fugitive slaves escape into freedom.  By the mid-1840s,  a group of abolitionists in southwest Michigan had created an organized system for transporting fugitive slaves.  Slaves were often brought to the Thomas House by Zachariah Shugart, a fellow Quaker living on Young's Prairie, Cass County.  Dr. Thomas would then shuttle the runaways to Erastus Hussey, another fellow Quaker living in Battle Creek.  The slaves would eventually make their way to Detroit and onto freedom in Canada.  The first physician in Kalamazoo County, Dr. Thomas not only practiced medicine but also became involved in state politics.  In 1837, he was one of 400 residents in Prairie Ronde and Brady (now Schoolcraft) townships who petitioned Congress in opposition to the annexation of Texas because of the territory's support of slavery.  Two years later, he joined others in founding a Michigan newspaper devoted to the antislavery cause and in 1845 ran unsuccessfully as Lt. Governor on the abolitionist Liberty Party ticket.  A key participant in an 1854 antislavery convention in Jackson, Michigan, Dr. Thomas was a nominating committee member of the newly-formed Michigan Republican party.

It continues to house Michigan's first African American\r\ncongregation.  The congregation was established in 1836, when 13 former slaves decided to\r\nleave the First Baptist Church because of its discriminatory practices.  The church quickly\r\nbecame involved in the period's most bitter dispute--slavery.  First meeting at a hall on Fort St,\r\nthe congregation moved to the present location in 1857.  Just miles away from the freedom that\r\nthe Canadian border offered to escaped slaves, the church soon became a stop on the\r\nUnderground Railroad.  Its leaders helped form the Amherstburg Baptist Association and the\r\nCanadian Anti-Slavery Baptist Association, both of which supported abolitionism.  These\r\norganizations aided the ever-increasing number of fugitive slaves fleeing north, both spiritually\r\nand materially.  Significant figures in the abolitionist movement were associated with the church,\r\nsuch as Soujourner Truth, John Brown, and Frederick Douglass.  Douglass discussed abolition\r\nwith Second Baptist leaders before addressing citizens at the church 1859.\r\n     \r\n<p>The church's activism was not limited to slavery, however.  In 1843 and in 1865, it\r\nhosted a \"State Convention of Colored Citizens\" to petition the Michigan government for Negro\r\nSuffrage.  After the Civil War, the church played a vital role in helping thousands of migrating\r\nfreed slaves in securing homes and jobs in and around Detroit.  The present Second Baptist\r\nChurch building replaced the Congregation's first church which was destroyed by fire in 1914. \r\nTwo additions, one in 1926, and a second in 1968, flank either side of the building and testify to\r\nthe congregation's continued vitality.  The Second Baptist Church today remains, as it has been\r\nthroughout its history, a source of inspiration and encouragement to its members and neighbors.\r\n\r\n\r\n <P>\r\n<I>The Second Baptist Church is at located at 441 Monroe Street, just east of the intersection of\r\nGratiot Avenue (US 25) and Woodward Avenue within the Greektown Historic District.  The\r\nbuilding is open to the public.\r\n  </I>\r\n\r\n\r\n<P>\r\n<font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><b>    <A HREF=\"mi1.htm\">Previous</A>  | <A HREF=\"states.htm\">List of Sites</A> | <A HREF=\"ugrrhome.htm\">Home</A> |\r\n <A HREF=\"in1.htm\">Next</A> </b></font>\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n<P>\r\n<MAP NAME=\"timeline\">\r\n    <AREA SHAPE=\"rect\" COORDS=\"506,9,576,35\" HREF=\"civilwar.htm\">\r\n    <AREA SHAPE=\"rect\" COORDS=\"329,9,454,31\" HREF=\"opugrr.htm\">\r\n    <AREA SHAPE=\"rect\" COORDS=\"152,10,259,33\" HREF=\"antislav.htm\">\r\n    <AREA SHAPE=\"rect\" COORDS=\"21,8,117,33\" HREF=\"slvtrade.htm\">\r\n</MAP><IMG SRC=\"graphics/timeline.gif\" WIDTH=\"600\" HEIGHT=\"46\" ALT=\"\" BORDER=\"0\"\r\nNATURALSIZEFLAG=\"0\" ALIGN=\"center\" USEMAP=\"#timeline\" ISMAP>\r\n\r\n</TD>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n <FONT SIZE=-1>\r\n  <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/subjects/heritagetravel/frequently-asked-questions.htm\">Comments or Questions</A><br>\r\nLast Modified: <!--#include virtual=\"/scripts/lastmod\"-->EST<p>\r\n</FONT></P></CENTER>\r\n</CENTER>\r\n<IMG SRC=\"graphics/foster.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">\r\n<img border=\"0\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"graphics/fostitle.gif\">\r\n</BODY></HTML>\r\n", "https://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/underground/in1.htm": "<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN\">\r\n<html>\r\n<head>\r\n<script src=\"//www.nps.gov/common/commonspot/templates/js/federated-analytics.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\r\n<!--<link href=\"../../scripts/intercept.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\r\n<script src=\"../../scripts/intercept.js\"></script>  -->\r\n  <meta NAME=\"Author\" CONTENT=\"Sarah Dillard Pope\">\r\n  <meta NAME=\"GENERATOR\" CONTENT=\"Mozilla/3.01Gold (Win16; I) [Netscape]\">\r\n  <meta NAME=\"Description\" CONTENT=\"Bethel AME Church-- Indiana\">\r\n  <meta NAME=\"KeyWords\" CONTENT=\"Underground Railroad,Historic, Preservation, African American, slavery,architecture, History\">\r\n  <title>Aboard the Underground Railroad-- Bethel AME Church, Indiana</title>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n</div>  </head>\r\n <body BGCOLOR=\"#FFFFFF\" LINK=\"#663366\" VLINK=\"#828282\">\r\n<center>\r\n<center>\r\n\r\n<tr><th height=\"66\" colspan=\"0\" valign=\"top\"><a href=\"http://www.nps.gov\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"graphics/NPS-header.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"66\" border=\"0\" /></a></th>\r\n</tr><p>\r\n\r\n<img SRC=\"graphics/uheader.gif\" ALT=\"Underground Railroad Travel Itinerary Header\" HEIGHT=\"55\" WIDTH=\"600\"></center>\r\n <table CELLSPACING=\"5\" CELLPADDING=\"0\" WIDTH=\"600\"> \r\n    \r\n    <tr VALIGN=\"TOP\">\r\n      <td WIDTH=\"600\"> \r\n        <div align=\"center\"><img SRC=\"graphics/beititle.gif\" ALT VSPACE=\"5\" width=\"273\" height=\"38\"><br clear=\"all\">\r\n        </div>\r\n        <table align=\"left\" width=\"260\"><tr>  <td WIDTH=\"250\" ALIGN=\"left\"><img SRC=\"graphics/bethin.jpg\" ALT=\"Bethel AME Church\" HEIGHT=\"254\" WIDTH=\"250\"><font SIZE=\"1\" FACE=\"ARIAL\">\r\n<b>Bethel AME Church</b><br>\r\n<i>Photograph by Suzanne Rollins.

Originally founded in 1836 by William Paul Quinn and Augustus \r\n        Turner, the church, then known as &quot;Indianapolis Station,&quot; started \r\n        with a small congregation that met in Quinn's log cabin. In 1841 a small \r\n        house of worship was constructed, and by 1848 the church had 100 members \r\n        and became active in the antislavery movement, often harboring fugitive \r\n        slaves en route to Canada. Their promotion of the abolitionist movement \r\n        and their activities in the Underground Railroad were not well received \r\n        by some members of the local community. Supporters of slavery are believed \r\n        to be the cause of the fire that destroyed the church in 1862. Undaunted \r\n        by this tragedy, the congregation raised money to rebuild the church in \r\n        1867-- the same church that stands today. Known as the &quot;mother church&quot; \r\n        of the African Methodist faith in Indiana, Bethel also played an important \r\n        role in the community after the Civil War. Bethel opened schools for African \r\n        Americans throughout the city, and a kindergarten was at one time operated \r\n        in the church building. Numerous organizations were established at Bethel, \r\n        including the Indianapolis chapter of the NAACP and the Indiana State \r\n        Federation of Colored Woman's Clubs. Bethel AME has been a vanguard in \r\n        the advancement of the AME movement and occupies a unique place in the \r\n        history of the Underground Railroad. \r\n        <p> <i> Bethel AME Church is located in Indianapolis, Indiana at 414 West \r\n          Vermont Street.

Because of his outstanding \r\n        role in the operation of the Underground Railroad, Coffin has been termed \r\n        its &quot;president.&quot; It is believed that Coffin and his wife Catharine \r\n        helped more than 2,000 fugitive slaves escape to freedom, using this house \r\n        as a principal depot. Coffin was born in North Carolina and in 1826 moved \r\n        to Fountain City, at that time called Newport, where he operated a general \r\n        merchandise store. In 1847 the Coffins moved to Cincinnati and opened \r\n        a store that dealt in goods made by free labor and continued with their \r\n        antislavery activities. Immediately after the issuance of the Emancipation \r\n        Proclamation, Coffin worked to aid freedmen. In 1864 he went to England \r\n        and was instrumental in the formation of an Englishman's Freedmen's Aid \r\n        Society which contributed money, clothing, and other articles to newly \r\n        freed African Americans. In 1867 Coffin attended the International Anti-Slavery \r\n        Conference in Paris. Following this event he lived in retirement until \r\n        his death in 1877. Coffin's accounts on his activities as the &quot;president&quot; \r\n        of the Underground Railroad were published in an 1876 book \r\n        entitled <i> Reminiscences of Levi Coffin</i> . \r\n        <p>\r\n        <i>The Levi Coffin House, owned by the Indiana State Museum and Historic Sites, is located in Fountain City, Indiana, at 113 U.S. 27 North. \r\n        It is open to the public from June 1-August 31, Tuesday-Saturday, 1:00-4:00 \r\n        pm.

Some of the college's trustees were among the most\r\nactive participants in the Underground Railroad in and around Lancaster.  From the Greek\r\n Eleutheros' meaning &quot;freedom and equality,&quot; the school embodied its founders antislavery\r\nsentiments, and the school's location, atop the highest hill in the area, was a physical and symbolic\r\nstatement of the community's beliefs.   Continuing to operate as a private, coeducational secondary school until the mid-1880s, the college was purchased by Lancaster Township in 1888 and used as a public school until 1938.  Today, Eleutherian College Classroom and Chapel Building stands vacant.\r\n <p>\r\n\r\nLancaster was a known stop for fugitive slaves traveling from Madison, Indiana to Indianapolis. \r\nThree of Eleutherian's trustees, Samuel Tibbetts, Lyman Hoyt, and James Nelson, were frequently\r\nmentioned in connection with the Underground Railroad and its efforts in the vicinity of Lancaster\r\nand Madison.

It was built in limestone about 1850 in Greek Revival style, and housed the Hoyts -- Lyman (1804-1857), Asenath (1810-1897), and their seven children.  Lyman was a landowner and a woodworking factory owner. Lyman and his wife were among the main Underground Railroad activists in Lancaster from 1830 to 1856. Lyman hid freedom seekers in his barn loft and a cave near his home and gave them clothing, food, and transportation in his wagons. His nephew wrote a reminiscence in 1888 describing one instance of transportation for those fleeing in 1845, and in 1930 his daughter remembered hiding runaways in a cave on their property.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Hoyt family moved to Lancaster from Vermont at the suggestion of Asenath's sister who lived there. Located near the Ohio River separating Indiana and Kentucky, Lancaster was established as a community which opposed the institution of slavery. Founded primarily by New England Baptists, by 1839 there were enough abolitionists to form the Neil's Creek Anti-Slavery Society. Disbanded in 1845, it was followed in 1846, however, by the Neil's Creek Anti-Slavery Baptist Church, meeting in the same schoolhouse and having many of the same members. Members of the Neil's Creek Anti-Slavery Society attended the state Anti-Slavery convention in 1839, and affiliated themselves with the National Liberty Party in 1845. Lyman was an active member of the Neil's Creek Anti-Slavery Society, attended the state convention, and in 1839 helped draft a series of resolutions for the local society. He also wrote for The Philanthropist, a Cincinnati antislavery newspaper. In 1849 he and other abolitionists helped Thomas Craven to found Eleutherian College, open to all regardless of gender or race. Lyman Hoyt died in 1857. Lancaster continued helping freedom seekers up to the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863. By the time Asenath died in 1897, her obituary could openly state <br>\"He (Lyman) and his wife were strongly against slavery and their home in Jefferson county was one of the stations of the underground railroad.\" </p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Lyman and Asenath Hoyt House is located at 7147 West State Road 250, Madison, Indiana.

The unique feature about this  neighborhood is that the homes, churches, and environment that the freedom  seekers, conductors, and abolitionists involved in the Underground Railroad saw  still exist today. The Underground Railroad-associated African Methodist  Episcopal Church and Colored Baptist Church still stand, as do the homes of  Underground Railroad leaders like William and Elijah Anderson.</p>\r\n <p>Georgetown,  located just five blocks from the Ohio River, became a place in which hundreds  of freedom seekers found a community of safe houses and conductors willing to  give them aid to reach the next station toward freedom from the 1830s on. The  Ohio River is shallow and narrow at Madison, and during the early nineteenth  century it experienced seasonal lows. Several deep creek beds draining into the  Ohio near the east end of the town lead from the river into rural Indiana,  allowing an easy route north. These geographic features made the Madison area a prime location  for freedom seekers from Kentucky to cross the Ohio River. Madison could be  dangerous, however, as it contained a mix of ardent abolitionists willing to  become active in the Underground Railroad and pro-slavery activists wanting to  break up this community. Men such as Madison's notorious Sheriff Rea actively sought rewards for returning to slave owners those  fleeing from slavery.</p>\r\n <p>Colored  Baptist Church, also known as the Walnut Street Methodist Episcopal Church (711  Walnut Street), was built in 1839 when 78 members of the Wesley Chapel in  Madison split off because white members of the choir took seats originally  meant for the African Americans. Several members of the Colored Baptist Church  congregation were active in the Underground Railroad and this activity brought  white mobs into Georgetown during the tense mid-century years. The number of  raids and their violence began to escalate to a point that leaders of the  church asked Underground Railroad activists like William Anderson and George  DeBaptiste to stop their activities for the safety of the community. This request prompted several members like  William Anderson to break off from the Colored Baptist church and form the  African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME) which became the site of worship for  many of the leaders of the Underground Railroad. After the split, William  Anderson built the present AME building in 1849 (309 East Fifth Street) and then  deeded the property to three trustees of the church. </p>\r\n <p>William  Anderson (1811-1867) was born in Hanover County, Virginia, to a free black  woman, and was bound to a slaveholder. He recalled having been sold or  exchanged eight times. Eventually, he escaped slavery and arrived in Madison in  1836. The brick house (713 Walnut Street) was his family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home from c. 1838 to  1859. In December 1856, Anderson was arrested aboard the steamer <em>Telegraph </em>using a  warrant from Carrolton, Kentucky, accusing him of running off human property.  He was tried and acquitted of the charges. \u00c2\u00a0Having to sell his home and other property to  pay the incurred court costs, he later lived (313 East Fifth Street) next to  the AME Church. In 1857, Anderson wrote a narrative of his life, including his  work on the Underground Railroad. </p>\r\n <p>Elijah  Anderson (1808-1861) ran a blacksmith shop on the corner of Walnut and Third  Streets and built his 1840 two-story Federal style home at 626 Walnut Street. Because  of his light skin, he traveled with freedom seekers to Canada via steamboats and  trains, masquerading as a master traveling with his bondsmen. Kentucky citizens placed a $1000 bounty on  Anderson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head. He felt compelled to move from Madison. In December 1856, nonetheless,  Louisville police officers captured and arrested Anderson on an Ohio River  steamboat for taking a group of freedom seekers from Lawrenceburg, Indiana, to  Cleveland. He was found guilty of violating the Kentucky Law against \u00e2\u0080\u009cEnticing  Slaves to Run Away,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and sentenced to an eight-year term. Mysteriously, the day  Anderson was to be released from a Frankfort, Kentucky, prison in 1861, he was  found dead in his cell. </p>\r\n <p>Attacks  led some of Madison\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other most prominent Blacks to flee the city. George  DeBaptiste continued his Underground Railroad work in Detroit. Griffith Booth,  who had been captured and almost drowned in an 1849 raid by white Kentuckians,  moved to Kalamazoo, Michigan, and then Canada. Madison's loss of free Black  leadership pushed many of the Underground Railroad activities out of the city  and into the surrounding areas, where conductor Chapman Harris and the Neil's  Creek group were still active.

Born a slave in Norfolk, Virginia, \r\n        Parker was sold at the age of eight to a doctor in Mobile, Alabama. The \r\n        doctor's family taught Parker to read and write and allowed him to apprentice \r\n        in an iron foundry where he was compensated and permitted to keep some \r\n        of his earnings. Persuading an elderly female patient of the doctor's \r\n        to purchase him, Parker, at the age of 18, bought his freedom from the \r\n        woman with money earned from his apprenticeship. Parker moved to southern \r\n        Ohio and around 1853 established a successful foundry behind his home \r\n        in Ripley. Patenting a number of inventions from his foundry, Parker was \r\n        one of only a few African Americans to obtain a U.S. patent in the 19th \r\n        century. Though busy with his business, Parker was also active in the \r\n        Underground Railroad and is believed to have assisted many slaves to escape \r\n        from the Kentucky side of the Ohio River. Parker, who was well-known by \r\n        regional slave-catchers, risked his own life when he secreted himself \r\n        back into slave territory to lead fugitive slaves to safety in Ripley. \r\n        Once the slaves were in Ripley, Parker would deliver them to Underground \r\n        Railroad conductors in the town, such as <a href=\"oh2.htm\">John Rankin</a>, \r\n        who would harbor the fugitive slaves and help them to the next depot on \r\n        the network. In the 1880s, Parker recounted his life as an Underground \r\n        Railroad conductor in a series of interviews with journalist Frank M. \r\n        Gregg. These interviews have recently been edited by Stuart Seely Sprague \r\n        and published as <i> His Promised Land: The Autobiography of John P. Parker \r\n        Former Slave and Conductor on the Underground Railroad.</i> \r\n        <p> <i>The John P. Parker House is located in Ripley, Ohio, at 300 Front \r\n          St. The house has recently been restored, and is open on weekends from \r\n          May through the second weekend in December.

Incorporated in 1814, the\r\ntown became a center for pork packing and shipping and was especially successful in the milling\r\nindustry.  The strong Quaker population in Mt. Pleasant preached and practiced its abolitionist\r\nviews and published antislavery literature, such as Benjamin Lundy's <i>Genius of Universal\r\nEmancipation</i>. A station on the Underground Railroad, the town was a refuge for fugitive\r\nslaves and a welcome home for free blacks.  Local residents built and administered a school for\r\nfree black children, and in 1848 established a Free Labor Store which sold no products that were\r\nproduced by slave labor.  Rice, for instance, was made by Quakers and cotton was made by\r\nGerman immigrants, but nothing sold in the store was produced from the efforts of slavery.  The\r\nstore remained open until 1857.  As an important station on the Underground Railroad and a\r\ndistinct voice in the abolitionist sentiment, the village of Mount Pleasant played a vital role in the\r\nantislavery movement.    \r\n\r\n\r\n <p>\r\n<i> The Village of Mt.

Wilson Bruce Evans and his brother Henry Evans were participants in the well-known 1858 Oberlin-Wellington Rescue.  This rescue of an escaped slave, who had been captured\r\nand was to be taken back to his master in Kentucky, was one of several open and well-publicized\r\nconfrontations over the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 and was significant in fueling the sectional\r\ndifferences in the United States prior to the Civil War.   Wilson Bruce and Henry Evans were born\r\ninto freedom in Fayetteville, North Carolina and learned the trade of cabinetmaking and carpentry\r\nas young men.  In 1854, they moved with their respective families to Oberlin, a college\r\ncommunity known for its support of free blacks, and established a cabinetmaking and carpentry\r\nbusiness.  The two brothers were not outspoken abolitionists like Harriet Tubman, Sojourner\r\nTruth, or Frederick Douglass, however they risked imprisonment to fight slavery and the Fugitive\r\nSlave Act. The desire of the Evans' to help their brothers and sisters held in slavery was put above\r\ntheir own personal safety.  \r\n\r\n\r\n <p>\r\n<i>The Wilson Bruce Evans House is located in Oberlin, Ohio at 33 East Vine Street.

Sloane (1828-1908), a Sandusky, Ohio, lawyer, abolitionist, and Underground Railroad participant.  The son of a local jeweler who arrived in Ohio around 1815, Sloane started studying law at the age of 17 and was admitted to the bar in 1849.  Purchasing this house in 1854 from its first owner and builder,\r\nSamuel Torrey, Sloane practiced law in Sandusky and became involved in local abolitionist activities. His antislavery sentiments were most probably cultivated while studying law with lawyer F.D. Parish, a leading Sandusky abolitionist whose home was a known Underground Railroad station. One of Sloane's more well-known antislavery protests occured in 1852 when\r\nseven runaway slaves arrived in Sandusky on the Mad River & Lake Erie Railroad.  The slaves were later captured aboard a steamer by three men from Kentucky claiming to be their owners.  On behalf of the fugitive slaves, Sloane petitioned the mayor to investigate the evidence and questioned if the runaways were properly arrested and legally detained.  Finding no legal authority for the arrest, local officials ordered that the slaves be released immediately. Shortly afterwards, one of the Kentucky men displayed legal papers of ownership and filed charges against Sloane under the Fugitive Slave Act.  He was tried in the U.S. District Court in Columbus and fined $3,000 plus $1,330.30 in court and attorney fees.  The local African American community, in appreciation of Sloane's efforts, presented him with a silver-headed cane that today is on display at the Follett House Museum at 404 Wayne Street in Sandusky.  Three years after his trial, Sloane became a probate judge in Erie County and in 1861 was appointed as an agent to the U.S. Post Office in Chicago.   While in Chicago, Sloane made a fortune in real estate.  He became president of the Sandusky, Dayton, and Cincinnati Railroad in\r\n1867 and was elected mayor of Sandusky in 1879.

It was also the home of noted local abolitionist Daniel Howell Hise and his wife Margaret.  The Hises were members of the Society of Friends and through Daniel's activism hosted nationally renowned abolitionists including Henry C. Wright, Oliver Johnson, Parker Pillsbury, and Charles C. Burleigh when they visited Salem.  Daniel Hise was the son of Aaron Hise a blacksmith and tavern owner, and early Salem settler.  Born in 1813, Daniel inherited his father's blacksmithing and entertaining skills.  In the 1840s, he became active in the abolition movement.  Although witness to the injustices endured by slaves while he was a steamboat engineer in Alabama, it was radical reformer Amos Gilbert who, in Hise's words, \"first awakened my thoughts, and gave them a direction.\"  Both Daniel and Margaret were active in the Western Anti-Slavery Society (Daniel served as a member of the Executive Committee), located in Salem.  Salem was a prime location for this organization because of the town's high percentage of Quakers and proximity to large concentrations of abolitionists in the surrounding area.  Daniel also helped organize Salem's annual Anti-Slavery Fair, and aided various abolition efforts financially.\r\n        <p>\r\n\r\nThe Hise family purchased this one and a half story Gothic Revival farmhouse in the late 1850's.  after which they began renovations which included  hidden rooms under the house and in an accompanying barn. The Hise House was used as a temporary stop on the Underground Railroad, where fugitive slaves could eat and rest until nightfall, when they could travel to another station.  The house and family sheltered numerous runaway slaves, and Daniel was also involved in rescuing slaves that passed through Salem with their owners.  The Hise family also used their home to host numerous anti-slavery meetings and provided lodging to visiting abolitionists.<p>\r\n\r\n<i> The Daniel Howell Hise House is located at 1100 Franklin Ave., in Salem, Ohio.

The Benedict house was an active \r\n          station stop on the Underground Railroad, as well as a model of antebellum \r\n          Quaker architecture. Out of the estimated 100,000 fugitive slaves who \r\n          escaped with the assistance of the Underground Railroad at least 40,000 \r\n          went through Ohio. The Alum Creek/Peru Township area contained a sizeable \r\n          free and fugitive black population, an active Quaker fellowship, and \r\n          a local community with strong convictions about the immorality and injustice \r\n          of slavery. These combined characteristics made Peru area an ideal Underground \r\n          Railroad station. \r\n        <p>In 1812 several Benedict families migrated from New York to Ohio and \r\n          established the first Quaker settlement of Morrow County, Ohio along \r\n          Alum Creek. The Benedicts were the first Anglo-Americans to this previously \r\n          unsettled frontier area of Ohio. Reuben Benedict, along with his wife \r\n          Anna and their 12 children, were among these families. Benedict was \r\n          the first recorded miller in the township. Numerous accounts confirm \r\n          that the Reuben Benedict house was a station stop on the Underground \r\n          Railroad. A history of Peru Township written as early as 1897 states \r\n          clearly that &quot;Reuben Benedict's House is now Harry Green's and \r\n          was on the Underground Railroad.&quot; The house also played a role \r\n          in the locally famous 1839 case of Bill Anderson of nearby Marion County, \r\n          Ohio. During Anderson's trail, also known as &quot;Black Bill,&quot; \r\n          a group of Virginians attempt to return him to Virginia. Because Anderson \r\n          was considered a free man by the court, and the Virginians could not \r\n          prove ownership, he was released. However, after a second attempt to \r\n          take Anderson to Virginia, a group of local Quakers helped him to Benedict's \r\n          house to escape further capture, and from where he could move further \r\n          north. The Benedict house is a unique Underground Railroad station because \r\n          it retains a high degree of historic integrity. The house maintains \r\n          much of its original plan and design, and is one of the few examples \r\n          of the Federal vernacular style surviving in the area. \r\n        <p> <i> The Reuben Benedict House is located at 1463 County Rd. 24, in \r\n          Peru Township near Marengo, Ohio.

The presence \r\n        of two colleges in College Hill attracted abolitionist Presbyterian educators. \r\n        These educational opportunities attracted Samuel and Sally Wilson, Presbyterians \r\n        who had been criticized while living in Reading, Ohio, for their abolitionist \r\n        view. Two of their seven children had previously attended the <i>Cary \r\n        Academy</i> in College Hill and in 1848 their daughter Mary became a charter \r\n        faculty member of the <i>Ohio Female College</i> there, which admitted \r\n        women and employed female faculty. \r\n        <p>The Wilsons built their Greek Revival home in College Hill in 1849, \r\n          after which it became a station on the Underground Railroad until at \r\n          least 1852. During these years, ten members of the family lived in the \r\n          house, including four adult children, three grandchildren, and an aunt. \r\n          In this house the Wilson family made important contributions to the \r\n          history of the community through their leadership in American educational, \r\n          religious, political and civic events. The abolitionist efforts of three \r\n          of the adult children, Mary Jane Wilson Pyle, Harriet Nesmith Wilson, \r\n          and Joseph Gardner Wilson, are documented in many sources. Mary, widowed \r\n          in 1848, had been teaching at the College since then, while the youngest \r\n          daughter Harriet taught in local public schools for 30 years, and lived \r\n          at the Wilson house from 1849 until her death at age 95 in 1920. The \r\n          youngest son Joseph was also a local professor, and lived at home until \r\n          1852. Joseph collected apparel from the families of this students and \r\n          cooperated in obtaining disguises for runaways.</p>\r\n        <p>While the other four adults who lived in the house are not mentioned \r\n          by name in existing documentation, they probably assisted fugitive slaves \r\n          during the years that the house was used as a station. A local publication \r\n          by the Cincinnati Historic Society states &quot;All the Wilson children \r\n          were active in the abolitionist movement and aided many Blacks to make \r\n          their way north by supplying food, clothing, and a hiding place.&quot; \r\n          In the early 20th century several groups of elderly African American \r\n          men returned to the house and asked to see the cellar where they had \r\n          once hidden and recognized the Wilson's former housekeeper, Christine \r\n          Gramm, still living at house where she had first been employed in the \r\n          1850s. An extensive letter written by Harriet Wilson in 1892 describes \r\n          her family's efforts helping slaves escape through College Hill. On \r\n          one occasion when pursuers were headed to College Hill to search for \r\n          runaway slaves, Harriet state &quot;The women being 'entertained' by \r\n          our family were terribly frightened declaring 'that they would die rather \r\n          than be taken and carried back.' Though quite large in size they were \r\n          ready and willing to crawl through a small aperture into a dark cellar \r\n          where they would be safe.&quot; She states that her sister Mary &quot;was \r\n          for many years a teacher. . .and were living could give you vivid pictures \r\n          of the workings of the Underground R.R., for but a few who traveled \r\n          by it to College Hill, but who were encouraged by her words of cheer \r\n          and aided by her helping hand.&quot; Harriet worked in Cincinnati and \r\n          returned to College Hill on the weekends. Prior to her trip home on \r\n          Friday evenings, she was given the number of slaves enroute to College \r\n          Hill so the &quot;stations&quot; were ready for their arrival. She recalls \r\n          that &quot;frequently, when at home on Saturday and asking for some \r\n          article of clothing, I would receive the reply, 'Gone to Canada.'&quot; \r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>After the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, Harriet recalled \r\n          that &quot;the work had become too well known. . . it was deemed wiser \r\n          to have it carried on by other less exposed routes so in the years immediately \r\n          preceding the civil war, there were comparatively none coming to the \r\n          Hill yet those interested in the cause of human rights did their part \r\n          financially to help in the work. . . &quot;</p>\r\n        <p> <i> The Samuel and Sally Wilson House is located at 1502 Aster Place, \r\n          in Cincinnati, Ohio.

This farmstead was the home of James \r\n          Clemens (1781-1870), who was the founding father of the settlement, \r\n          instrumental in starting the first school, donated land for the Wesleyan \r\n          Church and established a cemetery for the community. The Clemens were \r\n          also conductors in the Underground Railroad and soldiers in the Civil \r\n          War. </p>\r\n        <p>The records of the first landowners of Darke County, Ohio, show that \r\n          James Clemens was the first free black man to purchase land in German \r\n          township. Arriving with his wife Sophia in 1818 from Virginia, he soon \r\n          built a thriving farm business. Sophia\u0092s maiden name was Sellers, and \r\n          she is believed to be the daughter of Adam Sellers of Rockingham County, \r\n          Virginia the former slave owner of James Clemens. According to a map \r\n          by William Siebert in his manuscript <i>The Underground Railroad</i>, \r\n          Longtown (Greenville Settlement) was a stop in the Underground Railroad. \r\n          In Siebert\u0092s interview with Col. David Putman of Palestine August 13, \r\n          1898, Mr. Putman states, \u0093At the Greenville Negro settlement was another \r\n          station. The Clemens\u0092 and the Alexander\u0092s were the leaders in the movement \r\n          there. These were Negro families.\u0094 The Clemens\u0092 are listed as Darke \r\n          County operators in Appendix E (Directory of the Names of Underground \r\n          Railroad Operators) in Wilbert H. Sierbert\u0092s <i>The Underground Railroad \r\n          from Slavery to Freedom</i>. </p>\r\n        <p>Escaped slaves would stay in Longtown for a time, attending the Union \r\n          Literary Institute before continuing their flight to Canada. The Union \r\n          Literary Institute was a vocational school founded by residents of the \r\n          settlement with anti-slavery Quakers in 1845. At least on one occasion, \r\n          people searching for escaped slaves entered the settlement. Longtown \r\n          was a strong abolitionist community, and when men of color were allowed \r\n          to become soldiers during the Civil War, some young men from the region \r\n          joined the Massachusetts 54th, the first colored regiment of the United \r\n          States Colored Troops (USCT). James R. Clemens, grandson of James Clemens, \r\n          served as a private in Company A of the 8\"~United States Colored Troops \r\n          infantry. According to W. E. B. Dubois, Longtown became a haven for \r\n          interracial couples. Longtown is one of only two communities in Ohio \r\n          to be considered tri-racial: persons of African-American, European and \r\n          Native American ancestry lived here. The Clemens Farmstead, a two-story \r\n          brick house, sits about 100 feet from Stingley Road, and the facade \r\n          is a common bond brick pattern with classical Greek Revival details.</p>\r\n        <p> <i> The James and Sophia Clemens Farmstead is located at 467 Stingley \r\n          Rd., in the vicinity of Greenville, Ohio.

Upon the advice of Dr. Benjamin Rush of Philadelphia, they moved west to Ohio in 1811  to cure Charity's spotted fever with a healthier climate. Before their home was built, the couple lived in a log cabin on their 4,000-acre Spring Hill Farm on which they raised merino sheep. The home that stands today was designed by Jehial Fox. </p>\r\n        <p>As Quakers and regular attendees of the Ohio Yearly Meetings of Quakers at Mount Pleasant, Thomas and Charity used their home as a safe haven for slaves escaping to freedom in the North. Charity mentioned this practice in her journal and an 1821 letter to her sister in the East. The Rotches' story is the focus of a book by Ethel Conrad, <em>Invaluable Friends: Thomas and Charity Rotch </em>. By 1820, before the construction of the house, slaves had been harbored in the upper story of their log springhouse. After their new dwelling was built, the Rotches housed slaves in the basement kitchen area and the second floor. In the new house, a staircase led directly from the basement to the second floor while being hidden from the first floor. This staircase was likely configured to offer domestic servants an unobtrusive byway, but proved useful in hiding the movement of escaped slaves through the house. As a testament to their commitment to protecting their houseguests, no slave was ever caught at Spring Hill despite attempts by slave hunters. The Friends of Freedom Society and the Ohio Underground Railroad Association now recognize Spring Hill as an Underground Railroad site. </p>\r\n        <table align=\"left\" width=\"260\">\r\n          <tr>\r\n            <td width=\"10\"><br></td>\r\n            <td WIDTH=\"250\" ALIGN=\"left\">\r\n              <p><font SIZE=\"1\" face=\"arial\"> <b><img src=\"graphics/oh12_2.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"188\" alt=\"[photo]\" title=\"[photo]\"><br>\r\n                Wool House on the Spring Hill Farm</b><br>\r\n                  <i>Photo courtesy of Teresa M.

In 1830, Arvine Wales purchased the home and 60 acres, building a west wing on the house in 1831. Wales also supported the abolition movement. The Wales family has owned the home all but a few years since then. In 1910, the house saw more changes and additions, the last being a screened-in porch built in 1920. Today, Spring Hill is the oldest house of significance remaining in Massillon. </p>\r\n        <p>  <em>Spring Hill is located at 1401 Spring Hill Ln., in Massillon, Ohio .

The town's residents and institutions  played an important role in the Underground Railroad and in Ohio's debate about the abolition of slavery. Putnam was home to prominent abolitionists as well as  the location of two conventions of the Ohio Abolition Society. </p>\r\n        <p> The Stone Academy (115 Jefferson Street) is one of the oldest buildings in Putnam, built in 1809, and was the site of  two conventions of the Ohio Abolition Society in 1835 and 1839. Noted abolitionist speaker Theodore D. Weld was speaking at the Stone Academy in preparation for the first of these conventions when a mob of anti-abolition residents of neighboring Zanesville broke up the meeting. The Stone Academy was attacked again during the 1839 convention, and 200 anti-abolitionists intending to burn all of Putnam were met by 70 Putnam residents at the entrance to their community. Further violence was averted by the arrest of some of the instigators. The congregation of Putnam Presbyterian Church (467 Woodlawn Avenue) was actively involved in the abolitionist movement. William Beecher, brother of <a href=\"oh1.htm\">Harriet Beecher Stowe</a>, served as the first pastor of the church after it was constructed in 1835, and many other anti-slavery speakers spoke here including Frederick Douglas in 1852. A monthly prayer service for the abolition of slavery was held in the church's basement for many years, a service that was initiated at the Stone Academy in 1833.</p>\r\n        <table align=\"left\" width=\"260\">\r\n          <tr>\r\n            <td width=\"10\"><br></td>\r\n            <td WIDTH=\"250\" ALIGN=\"left\">\r\n              <p><font SIZE=\"1\" face=\"arial\"> <b><img src=\"graphics/OH_putnam2.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"165\" alt=\"[photo]\" title=\"[photo]\"><br>\r\n                </b>George Guthrie House <br>\r\n                <i>Photo from National Register collection, by Nancy Necchie</i></font></p></td>\r\n          </tr>\r\n        </table>                \r\n        <p>George Guthrie's Greek Revival home (521 Woodlawn Avenue) was built in 1841 and was a known station on the Underground Railroad, where Guthrie harbored runaways on more than one occasion. His wife wrote in her unpublished autobiography: &quot;I well remember hiding three children in our attic over one Sabbath while their owners were riding through the streets in pursuit.&quot; His brother, A.A. Guthrie, was the corresponding secretary for the Ohio Anti-Slavery Convention in 1835, and his house (405 Woodlawn Avenue) became the location of planning meetings  for the Ohio Anti-Slavery Convention after the mob stormed the Stone Academy during Weld's speech. Along with their brother Stephen, the Guthrie brothers were involved with hiding a woman and her four children in the home of a black man named William Harris behind the Putnam Presbyterian Church and sending the slave hunters to look in a nearby abandoned mine while the runaways were transported to a safer hiding place. Major Horace Nye and his wife Lucinda Belknap Nye were active abolitionists; Major Nye presided over the 1839 state convention, and Lucinda was the President of the Muskingum County Anti-Slavery Society.

Dr. F. Julius LeMoyne (1798-1879), the son \r\n        of a Parisian doctor who immigrated to the United States, was born in \r\n        Washington and studied medicine at the Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia. \r\n        In 1834, LeMoyne joined the Washington Anti-Slavery Society and was the \r\n        organization's president from 1835 to 1837, after which he was commissioned \r\n        by the American Anti-Slavery Society to be its regional agent. LeMoyne, \r\n        along with his children and wife Madelaine, were active in the Underground \r\n        Railroad. The tightly knit free black communities in southwest Pennsylvania \r\n        helped slaves escape and developed an operational network that white antislavery \r\n        activists, such as LeMoyne, joined. LeMoyne's correspondence from the \r\n        1840s includes letters from individuals asking for aid and thanking him \r\n        for his assistance in getting them and their friends and relatives out \r\n        of the South. In his activism and philosophy, LeMoyne represents the mainstream \r\n        of antislavery activity in the United States before 1850 and is typical \r\n        of the middle-class Americans of the antebellum period who became caught \r\n        up in the antislavery debate. \r\n        <p> <i>The F.

Built in 1837, Bethel  is the only AME church in Berks County that was constructed\r\nthrough the private resources of its congregation, many of whom were employed in Reading's iron\r\nindustry.   The four founding members of the church were Jacob Ross, George Dillen, Isaac\r\nParker, and Samuel Murray, who was primarily responsible for the construction of the church.  A \r\nlocal shoemaker, Murray owned 13 local properties and used them all as collateral to finance the\r\nchurch.  He also obtained a licence to preach, and subsequently became the first pastor of Bethel\r\nAME Church.  During the years leading up to the Civil War, the congregation of Bethel was\r\nactive in the Underground Railroad and members often harbored fugitive slaves escaping\r\nnorthward.  Jacob Ross, one of the founding members of the church, was himself a runaway slave\r\nfrom Virginia who had found support in the local black community and decided to settle in\r\nReading.  Today, Bethel AME serves not only as a place of worship, but also as a referral, social,\r\nand cultural center to the community.  \r\n\r\n\r\n <p>\r\n<i>Bethel AME Church is located in Reading, Pennsylvania at 119 North Tenth Street.

In 1840 he opened his home as a major stop on the Underground Railroad.  Hundreds of fugitive slaves from three different routes, coming from neighboring counties and Delaware, were directed to White Horse Farm. \r\nPennypacker personally transported slaves from his home to Norristown and other points to the\r\nnorth and east.  No slaves were ever apprehended while in his care.  John Greenleaf Whittier,\r\nanother celebrated abolitionist, said of Pennypacker, &quot;In mind, body, and brave championship of\r\nthe cause of freedom, he was one of the most remarkable men I ever knew.&quot; After slavery ended,\r\nPennypacker attempted to rejoin politics.  As a member of the Prohibitionist Party, he\r\nunsuccessfully ran as state treasurer of Pennsylvania in 1875 which marked the end of his political\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\n\r\n <p>\r\n<i>White Horse Farm is located in Schuylkill Township, Pennsylvania on Whitehorse Road.

Philadelphia, especially the Germantown section of the city, was a center\r\nof the 19th-century American movement to abolish slavery, and the Johnson House is one of the\r\nkey sites of that movement.  Between 1770 and 1908, the house acted as the residence for five\r\ngenerations of the Johnson family.  The third generation was active in the Underground Railroad\r\nduring the 1850s.  Along with their respective spouses, Rowland, Israel, Ellwood, Sarah, and\r\nElizabeth Johnson were members of abolitionist groups such as the American Anti-Slavery\r\nSociety and the Germantown Freedman's Aid Association.  Through their associations with these\r\nabolitionist groups, the brothers and sisters became involved in the Underground Railroad and\r\nused their home, along with the nearby homes of relatives, to harbor fugitive slaves on their\r\njourneys to freedom.  The Johnson House is a representative station on the Underground Railroad\r\nand the Johnsons among the leading abolitionists of their generation.\r\n\r\n\r\n <p>\r\n<i> The Johnson House is located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at 6306 Germantown Avenue.

Born into slavery \r\nin Dorchester County, Maryland, Tubman gained her freedom in 1849 when she escaped \r\nto Philadelphia. In Philadelphia, Tubman made connections and found support among other white and black abolitionists. Although Harriet Tubman found her freedom, she was separated from her family. Between 1850 and 1860, Tubman returned to the Eastern Shore of Maryland 13 times and freed more than 70 people, who were her family and friends so they can all be free together as a family.  Maryland planters offered a $100 reward \r\nfor Tubman's capture at one point during her time as an Underground Railroad conductor. \r\nActive during the Civil War, Tubman assisted the Union Army as a spy, nurse, cook, \r\nand guide. From Port Royal, South Carolina, in June of 1863, she aided a detachment \r\nof 150 African Americans in a raid up the Combahee River, destroying Confederate \r\nmines, storehouses and crops, and liberating about 800 slaves. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dedicating her \r\nlife after the Civil War to helping former slaves, especially children and the \r\nelderly, Tubman also became active in the women's rights movement and the AME \r\nZion Church. In 1859 Tubman contracted for seven acres of land and a house from Governor William H. Seward in Auburn, New York, for which she had lenient terms of repayment. It was to this property that she brought \r\nher parents after their intial stay in Canada, and where they stayed while she \r\nwas assisting Union troops during the Civil War. After the war she returned to \r\nher home in Auburn and began what was to be her life-long work of caring for aged \r\nand indigent African Americans. She supported the construction of the Thompson AME Zion Church in 1891. In \r\n1896, Harriet purchased 25 adjoining acres to her home on which stood the building \r\nnow known as the Home for Aged. Here she struggled to care for her charges, and \r\nin 1903 deeded the property to the AME Zion Church with the understanding that \r\nthe church would continue to run the Home. Tubman continued to live at her home, \r\nuntil her own health deterioted and she was cared for at the Home for the Aged. \r\nShe died there in 1913 at the age of 92 or 93 and was laid in state at the Thompson \r\nAME Zion Church. Though not directly associated with Tubman's activities with the Underground \r\nRailroad, these properties, designated a National Historic Landmark, are a tangible \r\nlink to this brave and remarkable woman who is known as &quot;the Moses of her \r\npeople.&quot; </p> <a href=\"https://www.harriettubmanhome.com/\">\r\n\r\n<i>The \r\nHarriet Tubman Home for the Aged</i></a><i> is located at 180 South St., her \r\nhome is located at 182 South St., and the church is located at 33 Parker St. \r\nin Auburn, New York.

An Underground Railroad station, the church is\r\nlocated in a community that was an important transfer point for fugitive slaves en route to\r\nCanada.  Many of these slaves, impressed by the support of the local community, decided to stay\r\nin Ithaca and constructed homes in the area surrounding St. James. The congregation officially\r\nexpressed its antislavery sentiments through the writings and preaching of its pastors such as\r\nThomas James who was known to have provided assistance to fugitive slaves.  Famous leaders in\r\nthe Underground Railroad are associated with St. James. Harriet Tubman, who played an active\r\nrole in AME Zion church affairs in central and west New York, often visited St. James and\r\nFrederick Douglass is documented as visiting the church in 1852.\r\n\r\n<p>St. James AME Zion Church continued to be a focal point in the black community of\r\nIthaca into the 20th century.  In 1906, in the basement of St. James, seven African American\r\nCornell University students, frustrated by the discriminatory all-white fraternities, formed Alpha\r\nPhi Alpha,  the nation's oldest official black fraternity.  Today, St. James plays an active role in the\r\ncommunity as a religious and social center of the southside section of the city.          \r\n\r\n <p>\r\n<i> St. James AME Zion Church is located in Ithaca, New York at 116-118 Cleveland Avenue.

A major turning point in Smith's life occurred when he\r\nattended the Utica Conference of 1835, where 600 antislavery advocates assembled at the Bleeker\r\nStreet Presbyterian Church.  A\r\nmob of 80 rioters, including Congressman Samuel Beardsley, stormed the church, forcing the\r\ngroup to flee the building.  Smith offered to host the meeting the following day in his home town\r\nof Peterboro, a small community named after Gerrit Smith's wealthy father, Peter. The events\r\nsurrounding the Utica Conference moved Smith to serve as president of the New York Anti-Slavery Society between 1836 and 1839.  By the end of his term, Smith was calling for abolitionists\r\nto defy the law and help fugitive slaves escape into freedom.  During the 1840s and 1850s, Smith\r\nacted as a &quot;station master&quot; in the Underground Railroad.  His Peterboro estate provided a widely\r\nrecognized safe haven for runaway slaves enroute to Canada and was recognized as a financial\r\nand intellectual center of the antislavery movement.  \r\n        <p> The Smith family had extensive land holdings in New York, and the \r\n          Land Office, constructed by Peter Smith in 1804, was the administrative \r\n          focal point of the family's real estate activity and business ventures. \r\n          Out of the Land Office, Gerrit Smith sold farm tracts for one dollar \r\n          each to 3000 poor African Americans, many of whom he had helped escape \r\n          into freedom, with approximately 140,000 acres being transferred betwen \r\n          1846 and 1850. Now owned by the Town of Smithfield, the building provides \r\n          a tangible link to the life of one of the Underground Railroad's most \r\n          active participants. The estate has  been designated a National \r\n          Historic Landmark.\r\n        <p>\r\n<i> The Gerrit Smith Estate and Land Office  are located in Peterboro, New York at the corner of\r\nNelson and Main Streets.

Shorter after capture, Brown was tried and sentenced to death. He requested to be buried at this farm, which soon after his death became a &quot;pilgrimage&quot; site for free African Americans and white abolitionists.  In 1849, John Brown moved from Springfield, Massachusetts, where he owned a wool brokerage business and was an active conductor on the Underground Railroad, to Lake Placid, New York.  Increasingly impatient with the stalemated public debate on the issue of slavery, Brown appears to have concluded that more decisive action was needed.  He heard of wealthy businessman <a href=\"ny3.htm\">Gerrit Smith's</a> plan to give parcels of land in upstate New York to free African Americans.  Purchasing a lot from Smith, Brown moved his family to the upstate wilderness area where he acted as a leader and teacher to the black families who were developing their own farms.  Brown and his followers had a difficult time farming the barren land around Lake Placid and a few of the homesteaders gave up and moved away.  This may have been the deciding factor in John Brown's 1855 move to <a href=\"ks1.htm\">Kansas</a> where two of his sons were leading an armed struggle against proslavery forces.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nAfter 1855, John Brown returned to his farm for only six brief visits to see his wife and some of his children.  After his death in 1859, his family and the remaining black settlers were left in a declining community that ultimately did not survive the harsh climate and isolated economy. John Brown's family moved to California at the onset of the Civil War, and in 1870 the John Brown Association was organized and purchased the site of the farm and grave.  The property was transferred to the State of New York in 1896, but the John Brown Association still organized pilgrimages to the site.  With money collected from private donations, the Association erected a statue of John Brown and a young African American boy in 1935 that stands near the gravesite.  This historic property commemorates the man who took on the forces of slave interests in an armed struggle that created one of the most enduring legends in the Nation's history.<p>\r\n\r\n<i> <a href=\"http://nysparks.com/historic-sites/29/details.aspx\">The John Brown Farm and Gravesite</a> are located on John Brown Road, just south of the intersection with Old Military Road in Lake Placid, New York.

Jacob Thomas, and Hiram Jimerson. Amanda Foster, considered the &quot;Mother \r\nof the Church,&quot; was the driving force in the formation of the congregation \r\nwhose first meetings were held in her confectionery store. Born in New York in \r\n1806, Amanda, in possession of her &quot;free papers,&quot; obtained employment \r\nas a nurse to Arkansas Governor Conway. While in Arkansas, she contributed to \r\nthe Underground Railroad movement by using her &quot;free papers&quot; to help \r\na young fugitive slave girl escape. She moved back to New York in 1837 and established \r\nher business in Tarrytown where she met and married Henry Foster around 1845. \r\nIn 1865, after five years of the congregation meeting in the Foster confectionary \r\nstore and other business establishments, construction of the church began with \r\nfunds donated primarily by the local Dutch Reformed and Methodist congregations. \r\nDuring the Civil War, members of Foster AME helped to provide food and shelter \r\nto fugitive slaves escaping to Canada, and also provided assistance to those fugitive \r\nslaves who decided to settle in Tarrytown. Like most AME churches, Foster AME \r\nis a religious and social crossroads for the black community, providing a meeting \r\nplace for worship and a place for public interaction. \r\n<p> <i> Foster AME Zion \r\nChurch is located in Tarrytown, New York at 90 Wildey Street.

Its minister \r\nat the time was Henry Ward Beecher, who had gained wide notice through his writings \r\nand skill at preaching of his strong abolitionist views. Beecher, born in 1813, \r\nwas brother of <A HREF=\"oh1.htm\">Harriet Beecher Stowe</A>, author of <I>Uncle \r\nTom's Cabin</I>, and son of Lyman Beecher, a well-known clergyman of liberal views. \r\nWilliam Lloyd Garrison, Wendell Phillips, Charles Sumner and John Greenleaf Whittier \r\nwere among other abolitionists who preached from its pulpit. \r\n<P>Beecher preached \r\nhis first sermon at Plymouth Church in October of 1847, Brooklyn's Second Congregational \r\nChurch. That church building was destroyed by fire in 1849 and a second church \r\nwas built and designed specifically to accommodate the crowds that came to hear \r\nBeecher and his colleagues. The weekly congregation averaged about 2,500 people, \r\nand Beecher's sermons were printed in pamphlet form and widely circulated. Beecher \r\nadvocated resistance to the extension of slavery, counseled disobedience to the \r\nFugitive Slave Law, declaring that the requirements of humanity were above those \r\nof the Constitution, and encouraged his own congregation to become active in the \r\nUnderground Railroad. He also auctioned several slaves from the pulpit of Plymouth \r\nChurch, both to secure their freedom and illustrate the grimmest aspect of slavery. \r\nToday, Plymouth Church's simple design continues to reflect the Puritan ethic \r\nof plain living and high thinking, and the walls that once rang to the sound of \r\nabolition oratory remain largely unchanged.</P><p> <i> Plymouth Church of the \r\nPilgrims is located at 75 Hicks St., in Brooklyn, New York.

Asa Wing (1815-54) was a  regionally recognized abolitionist lecturer and organizer in central New York. Asa  Wing's diary, augmented by contemporary newspaper reports and family tradition,  documents both his extensive work as an abolitionist agent and lecturer and the  use of the family house for the Underground Railroad. His diary entries for late  December 1850 document his and his wife's daring assistance in harboring the  Thompson family. The parents and five small daughters of the Thompson family rested  a couple days at his house while on their way to Canada. <br>\r\n</p>\r\n <p>Other diary entries tell of the  Wings' political activities. Asa and Caroline were at Liberty Party conventions  in October 1850, particularly the one when abolitionist Gerrit Smith was  nominated for president and African American minister Samuel Ringgold Ward for  Vice President. They knew both, and Ward had stayed overnight with them while  lecturing locally. In the same month Wing attended a meeting to protest the  Fugitive Slave Law where he spoke and he attended the trial of a boat crew  accused of causing deaths among a freedom-seeking family. At the 1851 New York  State Liberty Park convention Wing was appointed to the finance committee,  perhaps because of his success at raising money for William Chaplin's bail fund  after Chaplin's capture during an Underground Railroad incident.<br>\r\n   </p>\r\n <p>From the 1840s until his death his  greatest contribution to abolitionism was his oratory. He lectured frequently  in his home county, but also went as far as Connecticut. Other abolitionists  looked to him for coaching. Frederick Douglass praised his style and skills in  his eulogy at the dedication of Wing's memorial after his early death at 38 in  1854. Asa was a man of faith and ability despite the serious illnesses like  smallpox and tuberculosis that he suffered toward the end of his life.  Abolitionist Gerrit Smith prized him, and Wing left other sorely grieving  friends and family behind him when he died - several thousand attended the  dedication of his monument.

(1801-1886)  and Charlotte Clarke (1809-1867) built this large brick Italianate residence in  Oswego's historic Oak Hill section in 1857. Edwin's epitaph reads: \"Just  fearless humane\u00e2\u0080\u00a6He gave the best of his years and powers to the relief of the  oppressed and to the aid and succour (sic) of slaves escaping from bondage,  having in all he did the effective sympathy and cooperation of his devoted wife.\"  Family tradition recounts the role of Edwin and his brother in the Underground Railroad, with freedom  seekers lodging in Edwin and Harriet's home before moving on to his brother's.<br>\r\nEdwin Clark grew up in Oswego, and  after studying law, was admitted to the bar in 1828. He first served as clerk  of the Village of Oswego and then held a position with the Northwestern  Insurance Company. Harriet, whom he married in 1833, was a teacher and  homemaker, and by 1855 they had six children still living at home. They  purchased the home at 80 East Mohawk Street in 1848.<br>\r\nWhile Clarke's interests ranged from  history to law to horticulture, his anti-slavery activities were extensive. He  attended numerous anti-slavery meetings, signed petitions, and most importantly  became involved in the Vigilance Committee, giving away anti-slavery tracts and  urging citizens to sign petitions. Clarke brought his law background to bear on  his abolition activities. Clarke used newspapers as a public forum to argue  against the legality of slavery based on the Constitution. He argued in 1847 for  example in the newspaper <em>The National Era</em> that the Constitution was an antislavery document. As documented in letters, in  1840 Clarke took leadership of the campaign to free James Watkins Seward, a  freeborn African American from New York, from potential enslavement in New  Orleans. His nephew reminisced that in the following year Clarke attempted  unsuccessfully to get a writ of Habeas Corpus to rescue an enslaved woman from  a canal packet right in Oswego.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p><em>80 East Mohawk Street, Oswego, New York.

For at least sixteen of  those years, he and his family were key helpers on the Underground Railroad. The  John B. and Lydia Edwards House, a two-story frame dwelling with proportions  and\u00c2\u00a0details of an urban Federal style  house, was built between 1834 and 1835, bought by John B. Edwards in 1836, and owned by Edwards until his death in 1895. It was located on the city's east side in open fields, only two blocks from the Oswego River. John Benjamin Edwards and his family moved to  Oswego in 1824 so he could work on the construction of a hydraulic canal. John  B. Edwards became abolitionist Gerrit Smith's business agent in Oswego. Documentation  of the Edwards' activities are remarkable,  both for detail and for the long time span covered. Edwards' letters to Smith between 1845 and 1860 refer to the use of the house as a way station  on the Underground Railroad, an activity in which his wife was a partner. John B. Edwards also arranged passage across Lake Ontario for freedom seekers on the  very last leg of their journeys to Canada.  On July 17, 1845, Edwards wrote  to Smith, \"nine poor fugitives from slavery's prison left this port last evening for Canada. They were, I am told, in much fear that pursuers were after them.\"  In 1855 Edwards wrote Smith that he had put ten freedom seekers, five women and  five children, aboard a steamboat for Canada. In 1860 he wrote, \"a smart  colored man, Henry, arrived here last evening. I will see to getting him  underway for Canada.\" <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>The  Edwards also entertained well known abolitionists, both black and white like  Samuel Ringgold Ward, a Congregational minister himself a fugitive from  slavery. In 1866 Edwards ran for alderman, and, despite some hostility to his  pro-abolitionist stance, he won. When he died in 1895, the local newspaper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  obituary stated: \"Like Gerrit Smith he was an abolitionist and took an active  part in abolition of the slave laws, attended abolition conventions and in  every way in his power contributed largely and liberally towards the freedom of  the black man.\" <br>\r\n    </p>\r\n<p><em>The  John B. and Lydia Edwards House is located at 144 East Third Street in Oswego, New York.

It is where, on the evening of October 5, 1851, Orson and Amy Ames sheltered the famous freedom seeker William \"Jerry\" Henry. It is the only remaining property in the area marking where \"Jerry\" hid on his escape to freedom. \"Jerry's\" widely publicized and popularly supported escape directly challenged the Federal government's ability to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. \"Jerry\" had escaped slavery in Missouri, and was working in Syracuse, when he was arrested as a runaway by Federal marshals in October 1851. He was rescued from imprisonment by a crowd of free blacks and other abolitionists attending a convention of the Liberty Party. Once his shackles were removed by a blacksmith, he was hidden for four days before escaping in a meat wagon to Mexico. In the village, he was taken to the home of Orson and Amy Ames, where he stayed one night only because of fear he might be easily re-captured on a main street so near the business area. Local abolitionists moved him next to Asa and Mary Whipple barn in a more secluded area in Toad Hollow. After two weeks, the committee brought him on to Oswego from which he embarked for Canada, reaching haven in Kingston, Ontario. Asa and Mary Whipple's son-in-law in 1899 told the story in a surviving letter.   </p>\r\n <p>Orson Ames was born in Connecticut in 1799 and moved to Mexico with his parents about 1804. He married Amy Perkins and had six children. A skilled businessman, by 1826 he operated a tannery and later ran a sawmill, a factory making scythes and axes, and a shoe store. He was the wealthiest of the core group of Mexico abolitionists. He began his abolitionist career in the 1830s. He signed the first anti-slavery petition from the county, and in 1838 volunteered to be part of the town's Vigilance Committee which helped freedom seekers escape. Amy died in 1851 and Orson died in 1867. (341) </p>\r\n <p><em>The Orson Ames House  is located at 3339 Main Street in the Oswego County village of Mexico.

They were abolitionists  and Underground Railroad activists in the Village of Mexico, from late 1832  until the Civil War. The Clarks welcomed freedom seekers, provided housing for  them either in the Starr Tin Shop, their own home, or in the homes of other  antislavery families, arranged schedules for forwarding &quot;the goods&quot;,  and provided transportation to the next station. The Starr Clark Tin Shop,  neighboring the Clark residence, is a two-story wood-framed vernacular building  built about 1827 with Federal details. It is located in the center of the  village along three major transportation routes, making it valuable for  Underground Railroad activities.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n <p>From his arrival in Mexico in 1832  until his death in 1866, Starr Cark (1793-1866) helped make Mexico one of the  most active abolitionist and Underground Railroad centers in central New York.  From his home and adjoining store in the Tin Shop, Clark helped to organize Mexico's first antislavery society. In 1835 he wrote the first antislavery  petition sent from Mexico. In 1838, he was a member of the Mexico Vigilance  Committee, and in one case, well-documented in the newspaper <em>The Friend of Man</em>, assisted a runaway  named George to go to Canada. Through the 1840s and 1850s, he worked to strengthen  the anti-slavery wing of the Whig party, and continued to sign antislavery  petitions. When a free black man, James Watkins Seward, was imprisoned in New  Orleans, Clark wrote to the New York Governor pleading with him to contact the  Governor of Louisiana to demand the man's release. Evidence to support the  Clarks' anti-slavery position is found in signed petitions, minutes of the  Oswego County Anti-Slavery Society, correspondence with other abolitionists,  the published account of the fugitive &quot;George&quot;, obituaries, and  accounts written by direct descendants. <br>\r\n   </p>\r\n <p>Clark was born in Massachusetts in  1793, but spent his youth in New York as well as New England. In 1815 he  married Harriet Loomis from Verona, NY, and in Danby they experienced a  religious conversion affecting the rest of their lives. They had eight children,  and their last son born in 1831 was named for Theodore Weld later one of the  best known abolitionist orators in the country. In Mexico Starr Clark managed a  store with which he was given use of the adjoining house and garden. He became  treasurer for the county in 1840.

A National \r\nHistoric Landmark, Rokeby was constructed by Thomas (1761-1851) and Jemima (1761-1846) \r\nRobinson, Quakers who were active members of the Vermont and Ferrisburg Anti-Slavery \r\nSocieties. Their son Rowland Thomas Robinson (1796-1879) made abolition the cause \r\nof his life and sheltered fugitive slaves at Rokeby. Hundreds of letters written \r\nto Rowland Thomas between 1830 and 1865 are now located at the Sheldon Museum \r\nArchive and Research Center in Middlebury, Vermont. With abolition as the most \r\ncommon theme, these letters were written by local and regional antislavery activists, \r\nas well as national figures such as Lucretia Mott, William Lloyd Garrison, and \r\nIssac T. Hopper. These letters show Rowland Thomas' involvement in the Underground \r\nRailroad and are proof that he harbored fugitive slaves at Rokeby, negotiated \r\nfreedom papers for former slaves from their masters in the South, and helped freedmen \r\nfind employment. Family letters not only validate Rokeby as a stop, they add to \r\nour knowledge, correcting and sharpening our understanding of the Underground \r\nRailroad and providing insight into how &quot;the legend outgrew the reality.&quot; \r\nNow a museum, Rokeby is fully furnished with Robinson family belongings, including \r\nfurniture, clothing, dishes, books, art, and other artifacts. \r\n<p> <i> Rokeby is \r\nlocated in Ferrisburg, Vermont on US Route 7 at the corner of Robinson Road just \r\nnorth of Ferrisburg.

Born in Litchfield, Connecticut, to a notable Congregational minister and his wife, Harriet Beecher Stowe moved to <a href=\"oh1.htm\">Cincinnati, Ohio</a>, in 1832, where she taught at the Western Female Institute.  While living in Cincinnati, she met numerous fugitive slaves and traveled to Kentucky where she experienced the brutality of slavery first-hand. It was also in Cincinnati that Harriet Beecher met her husband, Calvin Ellis Stowe, a teacher at the Western Female Institute.  In 1850, Calvin Stowe accepted a teaching position at Bowdoin College and the couple moved to Brunswick. Harriet Beecher Stowe was encouraged to write by her husband and was a published author before moving to Maine.  Based upon her experiences while visiting Kentucky and her interviews with fugitive slaves, Stowe started writing <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i> upon her arrival in Brunswick. Many of the characters in her book mirrored real-life individuals such as Josiah Henson, a fugitive slave who escaped from Kentucky to Canada along the Underground Railroad with his wife and two children.</p>  \r\n\r\n<p>Published as a serial in the abolitionist newspaper, <i>National Era</i>, in 1851 and in book form the following year, <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i> is considered to be the most famous example of antislavery literature.  The book became an overnight sensation in the United States and Europe and has been translated into 23 languages.  Harriet Beecher Stowe introduced the horrors of slavery to large numbers of Americans and became the object of violent hatred throughout the South.  Her reply to southern criticism came in 1853 when she published <i>A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>, a collection of factual material on slavery intended to justify the charges implied in the novel. The impact that <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i> had on the American public was so great that President Lincoln, upon meeting Stowe, is reported to have said, &quot;You're the little lady who started this great war.&quot; Though not directly linked to the activities of the Underground Railroad, the Harriet Beecher Stowe House, a National Historic Landmark, is the place where this influential writer penned her monumental novel, forever changing America's attitude toward slavery.</p>\r\n\r\n<i>The Harriet Beecher Stowe House is located at 63 Federal Street in Brunswick, Maine.

It is the earliest meetinghouse associated with an African American population in Maine and the third oldest extant African American meetinghouse in New England. Because of its easy access by rail and sea, Portland developed as one of the northernmost hubs of the Underground Railroad, the last stop before legal freedom outside the country. When the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 was passed, it allowed slave owners and their agents to track down freedom seekers in the north and return them to slavery. Portland's black and white activists reacted, providing them safe houses and helping to organize escape routes to England and Canada.\r\n          \r\n        </p>\r\n      \r\n          <p>Despite the trepidation of some members, the Abyssinian Meeting House was closely associated with the Underground Railroad and with local abolitionist activity prior to and during the Civil War. Ministers, leaders and members of the Abyssinian Church actively participated in concealing, supplying, and transporting refugees from slavery, as recounted in slave narratives and oral traditions. The Portland Union Antislavery Society, founded June 1, 1842, was one of several grassroots movements advocating the abolition of slavery in the South. The founding meeting was held at the Abyssinian Meeting House. Biographies, memoirs, and slave narratives call particular attention to the Underground Railroad roles of Reverend Amos Freeman, Charles Eastman, Addison Parsons, and Reverend Amos Beman. Reverend Freeman was the minister at the Abyssinian when the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 was passed by Congress. Charles Eastman was a leading layperson who joined the Abyssinian in 1850. Addison Parsons was a white teacher at the Abyssinian \"colored school\" in the mid-1850s. Reverence Amos Beman was minister at the Abyssinian in the years leading up to the Civil War. The only known reference to the use of the Abyssinian meetinghouse itself as a place to hide fugitive slaves is in the unpublished memoirs of a descendent of Reverend Freeman.</p>\r\n        <p><em>The Abyssinian Meeting House is located at 75 Newbury Street, Portland, Maine.

The African Meetinghouse, built in 1806 and the oldest known extant black church in the United States, was a place of discussion for many of the nation's most prominent abolitionists, such as Frederick Douglass, William Lloyd Garrison, and Charles Sumner.  Established in 1834, the Abiel Smith School was the first primary and grammar school established for black children in Boston. All of the sites in the National Historic Site are linked by the 1.6 mile Black Heritage Trail.

Through public lectures and editorials in the <i>Liberator</i>, the newspaper which he founded in 1830, Garrison argued unequivocally for immediate emancipation of slaves.  Born in Newburyport, Massachusetts, Garrison gained experience in publishing while an apprentice and in 1826 purchased a local paper which he named <i>The Free Press</i>.  After this newspaper failed, he moved to Boston and became joint editor of the <i>National Philanthropist</i>, a newspaper devoted to the temperance movement.  During this period, Garrison met Benjamin Lundy, who was already active in the temperance movement, and decided to start speaking publicly against slavery.  On July 4, 1829, Garrison delivered the first of many public addresses against the evils of slavery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the fall of 1830, Garrison founded the <i>Liberator</i>.  Although the paper seldom met its expenses and never had more than 3,000 subscribers, it aroused the Nation as few newspapers had in the past.  The <i>Liberator</i> was published until the ratification of the 13th Amendment with the final issue being printed on December 29, 1865.  Besides publishing his newspaper, Garrison also organized the New England Anti-Slavery Society in 1832 and helped to establish the American Anti-Slavery Society in Philadelphia a year later.  After the Civil War, Garrison went into semi-retirement but continued his campaigns for prohibition, women's rights, and justice for Native Americans.  After Garrison's death, his house was owned for a time by the Rockledge Association, an organization of African Americans formed to preserve the building.  In 1904, the house was acquired by the Episcopal Sisters of the Society of St. Margaret who own the property today.  Though not directly associated with the Underground Railroad, the William Lloyd Garrison House stands as a monument to the man who established the moral nature of the conflict that led to the Civil War.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>The William Lloyd Garrison House is located at 125 Highland Street in the Roxbury section of Boston, Massachusetts.

The Bowditch House is a modest example of mid-19th century wooden cottages, L-shaped with Gothic Revival elements.  Built in the planned suburban community of Brookline in 1844, the house was purchased shortly thereafter by Bowditch.  Bowditch, a conveyancer with an office in Boston, owned the house from 1845 to 1867 during the height of Underground Railroad activity.  He was extremely active in local Brookline politics, serving as a selectman and moderator of Town Meetings for a number of years.  Before the Civil War, he was an avid abolitionist, active in Brookline and Boston efforts.  Besides trying to sway public opinion through meetings, lectures and membership in the Boston Vigilance Committee, Bowditch used his house to shelter fugitive slaves.\r\n        <p>\r\n\r\nThe most well-known slaves to find shelter at the Bowditch house were William and Ellen Craft.  In December 1848, the Crafts began a dramatic escape from their different masters in Macon, Georgia.  Ellen, the daughter of her master and enslaved mother, was light-skinned and posed as an ailing white man, traveling to Philadelphia for medical treatment with her attending servant, William.  Throughout the tense journey, which led to Savannah by train, Baltimore by steamer, and by train again to Philadelphia, the Crafts were in constant danger of being discovered.  From a suspecting free black man on the train, William received the name of a Philadelphia Quaker who sheltered the couple upon their arrival.  Their journey ended in Boston, where they arrived in early 1849, and after speaking at the Brookline Town Hall, stayed at the Bowditch House and other Brookline Underground Railroad stops.  The Crafts fled once again to England after the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, but eventually returned to Georgia after the Civil War and converted a plantation to a freedman's school.  Another well-known guest at the Bowditch House during this tumultuous time was the son of abolitionist John Brown.  The young man was hidden by Bowditch after Brown's execution for his involvement in the <a href=\"wv1.htm\">Harper's Ferry raid</a>.  Bowditch is also known to have driven a slave, who arrived on the brig <i>Cameo</i>, from Boston to Concord.<p>\r\n\r\n<i>The William Ingersoll Bowditch House is located at 9 Toxteth St. In Brookline, Massachusetts.</i>\r\n<font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><b> \r\n        <p> <a HREF=\"ma2.htm\">Previous</a> | <a HREF=\"states.htm\">List of Sites</a> \r\n          | <a HREF=\"ugrrhome.htm\">Home</a> | <a HREF=\"ma4.htm\">Next</a> \r\n        </b></font>\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n<p>\r\n<map NAME=\"timeline\">\r\n    <area SHAPE=\"rect\" COORDS=\"506,9,576,35\" HREF=\"civilwar.htm\">\r\n    <area SHAPE=\"rect\" COORDS=\"329,9,454,31\" HREF=\"opugrr.htm\">\r\n    <area SHAPE=\"rect\" COORDS=\"152,10,259,33\" HREF=\"antislav.htm\">\r\n    <area SHAPE=\"rect\" COORDS=\"21,8,117,33\" HREF=\"slvtrade.htm\">\r\n</map><img SRC=\"graphics/timeline.gif\" WIDTH=\"600\" HEIGHT=\"46\" ALT BORDER=\"0\" NATURALSIZEFLAG=\"0\" ALIGN=\"center\" USEMAP=\"#timeline\" ISMAP>\r\n\r\n</td>\r\n</tr></table>\r\n\r\n  <font SIZE=\"-1\"><a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/subjects/heritagetravel/frequently-asked-questions.htm\">Comments or Questions</a><br>\r\nLast Modified: <!--#include virtual=\"/scripts/lastmod\"-->EST</font><p><font SIZE=\"-1\">\r\n</font></p></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img SRC=\"graphics/evans.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">\r\n<img border=\"0\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"graphics/evatitle.gif\">\r\n</body></html>\r\n", "https://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/underground/ma4.htm": "<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN\">\r\n<html>\r\n<head>\r\n<script src=\"//www.nps.gov/common/commonspot/templates/js/federated-analytics.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\r\n<!--<link href=\"../../scripts/intercept.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\r\n<script src=\"../../scripts/intercept.js\"></script>  -->\r\n  <meta NAME=\"Author\" CONTENT=\"Shannon Bell\">\r\n  <meta NAME=\"GENERATOR\" CONTENT=\"Mozilla/3.01Gold (Win16; I) [Netscape]\">\r\n  <meta NAME=\"Description\" CONTENT=\"Daniel Howell Hise House\">\r\n  <meta NAME=\"KeyWords\" CONTENT=\"Underground Railroad,Historic, Preservation, African American, slavery,architecture, History, Hise, william, Ingersoll, Bowditch, Brookline, Massachusetts\">\r\n  <title>Aboard the Underground Railroad--The Wayside</title>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n</div>  </head>\r\n <body BGCOLOR=\"#FFFFFF\" LINK=\"#663366\" VLINK=\"#828282\">\r\n<center>\r\n<center>\r\n\r\n<tr><th height=\"66\" colspan=\"0\" valign=\"top\"><a href=\"http://www.nps.gov\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"graphics/NPS-header.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"66\" border=\"0\" /></a></th>\r\n</tr><p>\r\n\r\n<img SRC=\"graphics/uheader.gif\" ALT=\"Underground Railroad Travel Itinerary Header\" HEIGHT=\"55\" WIDTH=\"600\"></center>\r\n <table CELLSPACING=\"5\" CELLPADDING=\"0\" WIDTH=\"600\"> \r\n  <tr VALIGN=\"TOP\">\r\n      <td WIDTH=\"600\"> \r\n        <div align=\"center\"><img src=\"graphics/waysidetitle.gif\" width=\"233\" height=\"41\" alt=\"[graphic] The Wayside\" title=\"[graphic] The Wayside\"><br clear=\"all\">\r\n        </div>\r\n        <table align=\"right\" width=\"260\">\r\n<tr>\r\n    <td width=\"10\"><br></td>  \r\n            <td WIDTH=\"250\" ALIGN=\"left\"> <img src=\"graphics/wayside.jpg\" width=300 height=180 border=0 alt=\"\"><font SIZE=\"1\" face=\"arial\"> \r\n              <b>The Wayside</b><br>\r\n              <i>Photo from Naitonal Park Service digital archives</i></font> \r\n            </td>\r\n\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </table>\r\n\r\n        The Wayside in Concord, Massachusetts, a National Historic Landmark, was \r\n        lived in by three American literary figures: Louisa May Alcott, Margaret \r\n        Sidney and Nathaniel Hawthorne. Hawthorne, author of <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>, \r\n        <i>The House of the Seven Gables</i>, and the short story collections; \r\n        <i>Mosses from an Old Manse</i> and <i>Twice-Told Tales</i> lived here \r\n        from 1852 until 1870 and gave it the name by which it is still known. \r\n        While The Wayside is best known as the only home Hawthorne ever owned \r\n        and the place where he wrote his last works, it has also been the home \r\n        of several noteworthy women. The Wayside, called \"Hillside\" by the Alcott \r\n        family, was one the childhood homes of Louisa May Alcott, the author of \r\n        the 1868 classic <i>Little Women</i>. Louisa lived here with her parents \r\n        and three sisters from April 1845 to November 1848 during her early teenage \r\n        years. The Wayside barn, which today serves as a Visitor Center and exhibit \r\n        area, was used by the Alcott girls to stage the plays that were created \r\n        when they lived at \"Hillside\"; including \"Roderigo\" from <i>Little Women</i>. \r\n        The Wayside exhibit and tour make note of the many events that occurred \r\n        at \"Hillside\" that are recalled in <i>Little Women</i>; as well as real \r\n        life experiences that the Alcott family had here, such as their sheltering \r\n        of a fugitive slave in early 1847. Mrs. Alcott's family included Judge \r\n        Samuel Sewall, who wrote an early anti-slavery tract, &quot;The Selling \r\n        of Joseph&quot; in 1700, and her brother, Samuel J. May was a founder \r\n        of The American Anti-Slavery Society and a conductor on the Underground \r\n        Railroad in Syracuse, New York. \r\n        <p>The Wayside, now part of Minute Man National Historical Park, also \r\n          pays tribute to the lives of several other significant women.

While teaching in Lynn, MA, Kelley developed \r\n        into a staunch abolitionist by reading William Lloyd Garrison\u0092s newspaper \r\n        <i>The Liberator</i>. In 1838, Kelly made her first public speech at an \r\n        anti-slavery convention in Philadelphia, and was so effective that Theodore \r\n        Weld begged her to continue speaking, saying, \"Abby, if you don\u0092t, God \r\n        will smite you!\" Kelley decided to become a reformer, but she did not \r\n        concentrate only on abolition. Throughout her crusade against slavery, \r\n        Kelley also voiced the importance of equal rights for African-Americans \r\n        and women, an issue abolitionists like Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan \r\n        B. Anthony also advocated. In the early 1840s, Kelley met Stephen Symonds \r\n        Foster--himself an outspoken abolitionsist--and in 1845, she married him. \r\n        Though both were widely sought after as lecturers, in 1847, the couple \r\n        purchased Liberty Farm, and immediately opened the house to slaves escaping \r\n        north on the Underground Railroad. After the Civil War, Kelley Foster\u0092s \r\n        attention shifted to equal rights and the enfranchisement of women, lecturing \r\n        to crowds of shocked listeners who had never seen women speak in public \r\n        before. Although too sick to speak in later years, Kelley Foster and her \r\n        husband still managed to voice their displeasure with Abby\u0092s inability \r\n        to vote--from 1874 to 1879, the Fosters refused to pay property taxes \r\n        on their attractive Federal-style farmhouse, Liberty Farm. Auctioned off \r\n        by the state several times, friends repeatedly purchased the house and \r\n        then gave Liberty Farm back to the Fosters. \r\n        <p> <i>Liberty Farm, a National Historic Landmark, is located at 116 Mower \r\n          St. in Worcester, MA.

Nathan Johnson was an active abolitionist \r\n          who assisted numerous fugitive slaves, including famous abolitionist \r\n          Frederick Douglass. The Johnson home was Douglass's first residence \r\n          after his escape from slavery in 1838--the only one of Douglass's three \r\n          homes in New Bedford that remains today. These properties have been \r\n          recognized as National Historic Landmarks.</div>\r\n        <p> At the end of 1853, the population of New Bedford was comprised of \r\n          a higher percentage of African Americans than any other city in the \r\n          Northeast, and almost 30% of those residents claimed they were born \r\n          in the South. New Bedford was attractive to fugitive slaves and free \r\n          blacks in part because of its major industries, the whaling and maritime \r\n          trades, which have historically been the most welcoming occupations \r\n          to people of all races. New Bedford also demonstrated a certain tolerance \r\n          of diversity, and black leaders of the time were impressed with the \r\n          political activity and degree of social organization among the city's \r\n          people of color, coupled with some access to capital and integration \r\n          in schools and some neighborhoods and workplaces. This black community \r\n          was composed of vehement abolitionists and abolitionist supporters who \r\n          were the audience of every principal antislavery lecturer in the United \r\n          States. The city was appealing to fugitive slaves, and their population \r\n          in New Bedford ranged at any time from 300 to 700. \r\n        <p> \r\n        Nathan and Mary Johnson married in New Bedford in 1819 and by the 1840s \r\n        had well established economic means. They owned a confectioner's shop \r\n        and other businesses, were well read in the political and social conditions \r\n        of the nation and willing to help the abolitionist cause in many ways. \r\n        Nathan Johnson was a steadfast delegate to the annual convention of free \r\n        people of color from 1832-1835 and was elected the president of the 1847 \r\n        National Convention of Colored People in Troy, New York. He and his wife \r\n        also supported the movement by harboring fugitive slaves in their home. \r\n        William C. Taber and Joseph Ricketson, two New Bedford Quakers, brought \r\n        Frederick Douglass and his family to the Johnson home in September 1838. \r\n        They resided there until 1839. The fact that Taber and Ricketson brought \r\n        the Douglass family to the Johnsons suggests that the Johnson household \r\n        was a common safe house for slaves in search of their freedom. Douglass \r\n        himself attests to Nathan Johnson's regular practice of assisting fugitive \r\n        slaves in all three of his well-known narratives. It is believed that \r\n        the old Friends meetinghouse was a safe house for runaway slaves as well, \r\n        however this has not been confirmed. The meetinghoue was not only the \r\n        first house of public worship in New Bedford, but also the site of Benjamin \r\n        Lundy's 1828 antislavery address. \r\n        <p> <i> The Nathan and Mary Johnson Properties are located at 17-19 and \r\n          21 Seventh St., in New Bedford, Massachusetts.

Corroborating written reminiscences and oral tradition \r\n          provide evidence that the house served as a station on the Underground \r\n          Railroad. Timothy Jackson (1756-1814) built the family homestead in \r\n          1809 after serving in the Revolutionary War and returning to Newton \r\n          to farm his family's land. His son William Jackson (1783-1855) moved \r\n          to the house in 1820, and established a soap and candle factory on the \r\n          property while also engaging in an impressive public career. William \r\n          was a member of the Massachusetts General Court from 1832 to 1833, a \r\n          member of the 22nd and 23rd United States Congress and, as a general \r\n          agent for the Boston and Worcester Railroad, was largely responsible \r\n          for routing the line through Newton. Locally, he headed the Temperance \r\n          Society, was founder of the Newton Savings Bank, the Eliot Church and \r\n          the Newton Female Academy. </div>\r\n        <p> Like his brother Francis Jackson, Treasurer of the Vigilance Committee \r\n          in Boston, William was an abolitionist and offered his home as a safehaven \r\n          on the Underground Railroad. William's role in the Underground Railroad \r\n          was recounted by his daughter Ellen, who recalled a night when <a href=\"ma3.htm\">William \r\n          Bowditch</a> of Brookline brought a runaway slave to the Homestead, \r\n          where he stayed until he could be taken to freedom. Ellen wrote that \r\n        <blockquote>\r\n          <p>&quot;<i>the Homestead's doors stood ever open with a welcome to \r\n            any of the workers against slavery for as often and as long as suited \r\n            their convenience or pleasure. The Homestead was one of the Stations \r\n            of the \"Under Ground Rail Road\" which was continually helping runaway \r\n            Slaves from the South to Canada. One night between 12 and one o'clock, \r\n            I well remember father was awakened by pebbles thrown against his \r\n            window. He rose asked what was wanted? Bowditch replied it was he, \r\n            with a runaway slave whom he wished father to hide till morning, and \r\n            then help him on his way to Canada, for his master was in Boston looking \r\n            for him. Father took him in and next morning carried him 15 miles \r\n            to a Station where he could take a car for Canada. He could not have \r\n            safely left by any Boston Station.</i>&quot;</p>\r\n        </blockquote>\r\n        <p>After William Jackson's death in 1855, his widow Mary Bennett Jackson \r\n          and three unmarried daughters were left in reduced circumstances, but \r\n          continued to play a role in the life of the community. In 1865, Ellen \r\n          helped to found the Freedman's Aid Society in Newton and served as its \r\n          President until her death in 1902. Contributions of bedding, clothing \r\n          and books sent to the black universities of Hampton and Tuskeege Institutes \r\n          are recorded in the Society's minute book. In 1906, after the death \r\n          of the last daughter Caroline, the house was refurbished and subsequently \r\n          occupied by William's descendants until 1932, when it was rented. Further \r\n          record of the oral tradition of fugitives being harbored at the Homestead \r\n          was based on an interview with William Jackson's granddaughter, Louise \r\n          Jackson Keith, who was one of the last Jackson descendants to live at \r\n          the Jackson Homestead before it was given to the City of Newton in 1949. \r\n          The Netwon History Musuem was established here in 1950, and offers a \r\n          wide range of public programs and exhibitions including interpretive \r\n          ongoing and annual programs on the Underground Railroad and abolition. \r\n        <p> <i> The Jackson Homestead is located at 527 Washington St., in Newton, \r\n          Massachusetts.

Critchlow button factory, which employed fugitive  slaves.&nbsp; With his newly acquired wealth,  Hill created new organizations in Florence  to support equal rights and social reform in the community, including the  Workingmen&rsquo;s Savings Bank and the Free Congregational Society. He also made  financial contributions to found both a new school house and one of the first  kindergartens in the United States.\r\n  <p>In  1849, Hill sold the farm to Abel Ross.&nbsp;  Ross&rsquo;s nephew, Austin Ross, lived with him at the farm for many years,  eventually purchasing the property in 1857.&nbsp;  Like Samuel Hill, Ross held abolitionist beliefs and was kicked out of  the Presbyterian Church because of his anti-slavery views.&nbsp; Remaining true to his values, Ross opened the  home on the property to the Underground Railroad.&nbsp; Florence  resident Anna Pauline Friedrick recalled &ldquo;His home was used as an underground  railroad, sheltering fugitive slaves in their flight to Canada&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp; Ross even sheltered one fugitive, a man whose  last name was Wilson, in his home  for over a year.&nbsp; Thanks to both of its  owners, the Hill-Ross home reflects the active abolitionist and Underground Railroad  history of the Florence section of Northampton.\r\n  \r\n<p><em>The Hill-Ross Farm is located at 123 Meadow Street in the Florence section of Northampton, Massachusetts.

Jones.&nbsp; Basil Dorsey,  originally enslaved in Frederick County, Maryland, escaped slavery with his  brothers after the denial of promised freedom by his slave owners.&nbsp; The Dorsey brothers fled to Bristol,   Pennsylvania where Basil found work on  Robert Purvis&rsquo;s farm.&nbsp; Louisa Dorsey&rsquo;s  brother-in-law betrayed Dorsey&rsquo;s escape to Thomas Saulers, Dorsey&rsquo;s former  owner in Maryland, causing local  authorities to seize and jail Dorsey.&nbsp; Robert  Purvis created local support for Dorsey by encouraging the local African  American community&rsquo;s presence at Dorsey&rsquo;s trial.&nbsp; Prior to the trial, Dorsey said &ldquo;I will cut  my throat in the Court House, I will not go back to slavery.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dorsey&rsquo;s counsel won a dismissal of the case  on the grounds that the prosecution was unable to supply authoritative  documentation that slavery was legal in Maryland.&nbsp; After the trial, Dorsey traveled to New    York City and was assisted by both David Ruggles and  Joshua Leavitt, editor of <em>The Emancipator</em>.\r\n<p><br>\r\n  Leavitt&rsquo;s  father, Roger Leavitt, later employed Dorsey at his farm.&nbsp; Roger Leavitt&rsquo;s home was well-known for its  hospitality to fugitive slaves.&nbsp; While  living and working on the Leavitt farm, Dorsey married and had three children,  though his wife died months after the birth of their third child.&nbsp; After the tragic death of his wife, Dorsey  and his children moved to Florence  in 1844.&nbsp; The family purchased a lot in  1849 and began building the Dorsey-Jones house, which was completed by  1850.&nbsp; The passage of the 1850 Fugitive  Slave Act threatened capture for Dorsey and his family, and Dorsey&rsquo;s friends, concerned  for the family&rsquo;s safety, raised money to purchase Dorsey&rsquo;s freedom.&nbsp; Their efforts were successful, and Dorsey officially  became a free man in 1850.\r\n<p>&nbsp; <br>\r\n  Selah  B. Trask purchased and briefly inhabited the home after Dorsey and his family  moved to the William Warner house at 4 Florence Road  in 1852.&nbsp; In 1854 Mary Jones, wife of  former slave Thomas H. Jones, purchased the Dorsey-Jones house.&nbsp; Thomas H. Jones was born on a plantation near  Wilmington, North Carolina  to enslaved parents.&nbsp; Purchased by a  shopkeeper at the age of nine, Jones worked as a clerk for many years.&nbsp; Jones married fellow slave Mary R. Moore in  1829, and purchased her freedom shortly thereafter.&nbsp; He attempted to purchase the freedom of her  children as well and freed all but one, Mary&rsquo;s son Edward.&nbsp; Jones arranged for Mary and her children to  be sent to Brooklyn. While traveling by sea to meet  them, Jones&rsquo;s slave status was discovered onboard the ship.&nbsp; Jones escaped the ship, and his arrest, using  a makeshift raft he crafted by hand.\r\nJones later settled in Boston and worked as a preacher. His steady income allowed  his family to leave Brooklyn and join him.&nbsp; In  1849 he published the first edition of <em>The  Experience of Thomas H. Jones, Who Was a Slave for Forty-Three Years</em>.&nbsp; The threat of the 1850 Fugitive  Slave Act forced Jones to flee to the Canadian Maritimes while his family  remained in Massachusetts.&nbsp; In 1852, the  Jones&rsquo; received notice that Edward&rsquo;s freedom could be purchased for $850,  bringing hope of reunification to the Jones family.&nbsp; It is not known whether the Jones&rsquo; ever  purchased Edward&rsquo;s freedom.&nbsp; Mary Jones  purchased the Dorsey-Jones house in 1854, and Jones lived there periodically  between preaching and lecture tours until the family moved to Worcester in 1859 and by 1867 had settled in New Bedford where he died in 1890.\r\n<p><em>The Dorsey-Jones House is located at 191 Nonotuck Street in the Florence section of Northampton, Massachusetts.

While the site of many illustrious  abolitionist burials, it is related to the Underground Railroad foremost for  the 1847 monument to the Reverend Charles Torrey. This monument was contributed  by a group of Boston abolitionists called \"The Friends of the Slave.\" Torrey  (1813-1846) was a martyr to the Underground Railroad who died in the Baltimore  penitentiary while serving a sentence for his activities aiding freedom  seekers. Born in Massachusetts, Torrey came south to Washington, D.C in 1841,  as a newspaper correspondent for the <em>Albany  Patriot</em>. Previously he had been an organizer of the biracial Boston  Vigilance Committee and involved with the Liberty Party. In 1842, he was  arrested for disrupting a slaveowners\u00e2\u0080\u0099 convention. He was inspired by the  enslaved family he found suffering in the jail with him, and went on to work on  the Underground Railroad in the District of Columbia area. He collaborated with  African Americans like Thomas Smallwood until caught, tried, and sentenced in  1844.\u00c2\u00a0 </p>\r\n<p>Other Underground Railroad activists buried at the cemetery are  Joshua Bowen Smith (1813-1879), George Luther Stearns (1809-1867) and Harriet  and John Jacobs. African American Joshua Bowen Smith,  a member of the Boston Vigilance Committee, employed freedom seekers in his  catering business, and hid them from bounty hunters.  After the Civil War he became a state  senator. White abolitionist George Luther Stearns often hid freedom seekers at  his Medford, farm, and became a member of the \"Secret Six,\" a group of men who  secretly financed the activities of abolitionist John Brown before his raid on  Harper's Ferry.  Following  Brown's hanging, Stearns devoted himself to recruiting African Americans for  the Massachusetts 54th and 55th regiments and founded the  Boston Emancipation League. </p>\r\n<p>In order to gain support for the abolitionist movement, Harriet  Jacobs (1813-1897) and her brother John Jacobs (1815-1873) each published a  narrative about their escapes from enslavement in North Carolina. Jacobs spent seven years hidden in the attic of her grandmother's house in North Carolina  until she escaped by ship to the north. There she was persuaded by her  benefactors to write <u>Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, Written by  Herself </u>(1860), the story of her suffering. During the Civil War she and  her daughter went to work among contrabands in Alexandria, Virginia, and then  in Savannah, Georgia. Her brother escaped north to become an abolitionist  lecturer. He worked in the Anti-Slavery Office and Reading Room in Rochester  and for the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society. He went on to become a whaler  and a miner in California and Australia. The monument of Peter Byus (1801?-1867),  freedom seeker from Virginia, depicts  a bondsman breaking free from his chains, and is based on the seal of the British Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade.</p>\r\n<p>Burials include well known abolitionists. Senator Charles Sumner (1811-1874) began his political career as an outspoken defender of the abolitionist movement and sparked political controversy with his speeches against the Fugitive Slave Act.  With his  wife author Julia Ward Howe (1819-1910), Samuel Gridely Howe (1801-1876)<strong> </strong>published <em>The Boston Commonwealth, </em>the daily  newspaper of the Boston Emancipation League from 1851 to 1853.  He was an active member of the Free Soil  Party and the New England Emigrant Aid Company, an organization started to  secure Kansas as a free state following the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854.  He joined the \"Secret Six,\" and  spent the years during the Civil War focusing his attentions on emancipation.\u00c2\u00a0 Notable authors James Russell Lowell  (1819-1891), Maria Lowell (1821-1853), Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807-1882) and  John Pierpont (1785-1866) supported the anti-slavery movement through their  writings.</p>\r\n<p><em>Mount  Auburn Cemetery is located at 580 Mount Auburn Street, Cambridge,  Massachusetts.

Williams House and Carriagehouse are significant for their association with the\r\nUnderground Railroad and the celebrated <i>Amistad</i> affair of 1839-1841.  Oral tradition\r\nindicates that Austin F. Williams (1805-1885), a leading abolitionist of the day who devoted\r\nmuch of his life to the cause, was an Underground Railroad conductor and, along with other\r\ncitizens, made the Farmington community a major Underground Railroad stop.  After the Civil\r\nWar, Williams was appointed director of the Freedman's Bureau of New England and New York\r\nand found housing and job opportunities for freed African Americans.  However, it was the\r\n<i>Amistad</i> affair that brought national attention to Williams' abolitionist activities.  In June\r\nof 1839, 53 members of the Mende tribe from present-day Sierra Leone who had been illegally\r\ncaptured and transported to Cuba, were sold to two Spanish planters in Havana. The slaves were\r\nloaded onto the ship <i>Amistad</i> which set sail for Puerto Principe, another Cuban port. \r\nFour days out of Havana, the Mende, led by Sengbe Pieh (renamed Joseph Cinque by his\r\nSpanish captors), took control of the vessel and ordered the ship to sail to America.  During the\r\nsiege the Mende killed the ship's captain and cook, and by the time <i>Amistad</i> anchored off\r\nthe tip of Long Island on August 24, 1839, 10 of the Mende had died from disease or wounds\r\nsustained in the takeover.  Brought into custody by the United States Navy, the Mende were\r\nimprisoned in New Haven, Connecticut, and charged with piracy and murder.  A defense\r\ncommittee, including Austin Williams and headed by Lewis Tappan of the American Missionary\r\nSociety, was formed and hired the Honorable Roger Sherman Baldwin and former President of\r\nthe United States John Quincy Adams to represent the Mende. The Supreme Court ruled that\r\nthe Mende had been held illegally by force and that the siege and murder of the captain and cook\r\nhad happened in self-defense.  The Mende were ordered free on March 9, 1841.\r\n\r\n<p>Upon their release, the Mende were taken in by members of their defense committee,\r\nincluding Austin Williams.  Williams constructed a building on his property in which the male\r\nmembers of the group lived.  This building is today the east section of the carriagehouse--the\r\nwest section was added on after the Mende had returned to their homeland.  The men worked in\r\nlocal agricultural fields and the women worked as domestics in the private Farmington homes in\r\nwhich they lived.  Required by the defense committee to attend the First Congregational Church,\r\nthe Mende also were taken to different parts of New England and asked to perform at various\r\nfundraising events.  With the money raised at these events, the defense committee hoped to\r\nestablish a Christian missionary in Africa and pay for the Mende's transportation back to their\r\nhomeland.  Within a few months, it became clear that the Mende were eager to return home and\r\nfelt somewhat exploited by these fundraising events.  On November 27, 1841, they set sail for\r\nWest Africa along with several missionaries and arrived in Freetown, Sierra Leone in January of\r\n1842.\r\n<p>\r\n<i> The Austin F.

Dr. John Grimes (1802-1875), the most noted and vociferous antislavery advocate in the family, was born in this house and lived here until 1828 when he moved to nearby Passaic County to practice medicine.  In 1832, he moved back to the homestead in Morris County and subsequently relocated to the neighboring community of Boonton.  New Jersey's citizens were divided over the issue of slavery.  Many people in New Jersey were sympathetic to the southern slave owners who had economic as well as social ties to the state. This faction was challenged by another group, largely comprised of Quakers like the Grimes family, who publicly opposed slavery.  Once arrested for harboring a runaway slave, Dr. Grimes was repeatedly harassed by supporters of slavery while living at this house and later at his home in Boonton. Dr. Grimes' participation in the Underground Railroad is substantiated in his 1875 obituary in the newspaper <i>Jerseyman</I>, that stated, \"In the earlier days, his father's house, Mr. Jonathan Grimes of Parsippany (Mt. Lakes today), was a prominent station on the celebrated Underground Railroad.  In later days it was transferred to his own home in Boonton through which many a poor runaway has been helped on his way to Canada.  They came to him from Baxter Sayre, Esq. of Madison (long since dead) he forwarding them in the night to Newfoundland, the next station.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<i> The Grimes Homestead is located in Mountain Lakes, New Jersey.

According to persuasive oral testimonies, Mott and his wife, Elizabeth Ann\r\nThomas Mott, provided refuge to escaping slaves during the years leading up to the Civil War. \r\n1870 census records show that Peter Mott was born in Delaware, and Elizabeth Ann Thomas in\r\nVirginia, but do not indicate if they were born into slavery.  Their names do not appear in New\r\nJersey records until their 1833 marriage which is possible evidence that one or both of the Motts\r\nmay have escaped slavery and fled to New Jersey.  The Motts settled in a free black community\r\nknown as Snow Hill which later merged with a neighboring settlement called Free Haven.  Snow\r\nHill, founded in the early 19th century, may have take its name from Snow Hill, Maryland,\r\nreputed to be the place of origin for many of its founding residents.  Free Haven was developed\r\nin 1840 by Ralph Smith, a white abolitionist who was the first Secretary of the Philadelphia\r\nVigilance Committee, an antislavery organization founded in 1838.  Smith named his\r\ndevelopment Free Haven to signify its role as a refuge from slavery and sold lots at low prices to free African Americans for homesites. In 1907, Snow Hill and Free Haven were renamed\r\nLawnside which became the only ante-bellum, black community to become an incorporated\r\nmunicipality in the state of New Jersey.  Peter Mott bought the first of three parcels of land on\r\nwhich his house was constructed from Jacob C. White, Sr., a wealthy African American dentist\r\nand active participant in the Underground Railroad.  Mott became an influential local leader and\r\nserved as a minister to Snow Hill Church, today named Mount Pisgah AME Church, and\r\nfounded its Sunday School in 1847. Peter Mott's legacy as an Underground Railroad conductor\r\nsurvives because of his prominence in a free black settlement, his ties to other known Underground\r\nRailroad participants, and the strong oral history traditions of the remarkable community of Lawnside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n <P>\r\n<I> The Peter Mott House is located at the corner of Moore and Gloucester aves. in Lawnside,\r\nNew Jersey.

Located in the heart of the black community of Springtown \r\nin Greenwich Township, the church and its congregation offered lodging to fugitive \r\nslaves travelling north after leaving Maryland's Eastern Shore and Delaware. Oral \r\nhistories attest that Harriet Tubman used the Springton/Greenwich station from \r\n1849-1853 during her passage north through Delaware to Wilmington - one of her \r\nmost famous routes. \r\n<p> The original congregation of Bethel AME Church had previously \r\nbeen members of various Methodist Episcopal churches in southern New Jersey. Until \r\nthe early 1800s, white and black Methodist Episcopals worshipped together at these \r\nchurches, as the members were all vehemently opposed to slavery. But as membership \r\ngrew, Methodist slaveholders joined these churches and pressured church leaders \r\nto soften their anti-slavery position. Eventually, black members found themselves \r\nunwelcome, and in Greenwich they formed the African Society of Methodists, which \r\nby 1810 had purchased a small parcel of land and a cabin or house. By 1817, the \r\ncongregation joined the newly chartered African Methodist Episcopal Church, which \r\nwas formed in Philadelphia. When their first church was destroyed by fire in the \r\n1830s, the present Bethel AME Church was built one mile away form the original \r\nsite in Greenwich Townshipand between 1838 and 1841. The new building was located \r\nnext door to the home of Algy Stanford, a church member and Underground Railroad \r\noperator. <p> Greenwich was originally settled by Quakers in 1685. After the Manumission \r\nAct of 1786, which enabled Quakers to free their slaves without financial hardship, \r\nthe village of Springtown gradually developed as Quakers starting selling small \r\ntracts of land to free blacks. By the time of the Civil War, Springtown had developed \r\ninto a large group of free land-holding blacks which made the area ideal for abolitionist \r\nactivity. For many fugitive slaves, Springtown was a temporary destination before \r\nmoving on, for others it became the end of their running. Their presence swelled \r\nthe size of Springtown and strengthened it as a force for abolition <p> <i> The \r\nBethel AME Church is located on Sheppards Mill Rd. in Greenwich Township, New \r\nJersey.

African-American hamlets were established \r\nin secluded areas on portions of Quaker land throughout western New Jersey. Small \r\nGloucester, also known as Dutchtown, emerged in the early 19th century as one \r\nof these African-American settlements. One well-known Underground Railroad route \r\nwas the Greenwich Line that began in the hamlet of <A HREF=\"nj3.htm\">Springtown</A>, \r\nled 25 miles north to Small Gloucester, and continued north to Mount Holly, Burlington \r\nand Jersey City, New Jersey. The communities along this route were ideal stations \r\non the Underground Railroad as they were situated about 20 miles apart, surrounded \r\nby Quaker land which was often swampy or dense woods, and inhabited by many free \r\nAfrican-Americans. For more than 10 years, <A HREF=\"ny1.htm\">Harriet Tubman</A> \r\nhelped operate this line.\r\n<P>The Mount Zion African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church, \r\na small one-story frame church built in 1834, was one of the important Underground \r\nRailroad stations in Small Gloucester from the time of its construction until \r\nthe beginning of the Civil War. Members of the Mt. Zion AME church supported the \r\nUnderground Railroad and actively provided protection, supplies and shelter for \r\nrunaway slaves. The church was always a safe haven, and several original members \r\nof the congregation, including Pompey Lewis and Jubilee Sharper, directed conductors, \r\nengineers and slaves north after taking care of their personal needs. A secret, \r\nthree foot by four foot trap door in the floor of the church's vestibule provided \r\naccess to a hiding place in the crawlspace under the floor. The AME Church was \r\norganized nationally in 1816 under the leadership of Richard Allen, a very successful \r\nAfrican-American circuit preacher.

The \r\n        Meeting House is associated with John Hunn (1818-1894) and John Alston \r\n        (1794-1874), two Underground Railroad &quot;station masters&quot; who \r\n        were members of the congregation. Referenced in William Still's 1872 book<i> \r\n        The Underground Railroad</i>, John Hunn gained notoriety by helping the \r\n        Hawkins family and several other fugitive slaves, in the care of freedman \r\n        and famous &quot;conductor&quot; Samuel Burris, escape through Delaware \r\n        and into Pennsylvania to freedom in 1844. Turned in to local law officials \r\n        by neighbors who lived near Hunn, the two men were sued by the owners \r\n        of the fugitive slaves for loss of property under the Fugitive Slave Law \r\n        of 1793; Hunn was fined $2,500, which forced him to sell his farm, and \r\n        Burris was sentenced back into slavery, but was later purchased from the \r\n        auction block by a Philadelphia antislavery activist. John Alston, another \r\n        member of Appoquinimink involved in the Underground Railroad, worked with \r\n        his cousin, John Hunn, in helping fugitive slaves escape to freedom. An \r\n        1841 entry in Alston's diary closes with: &quot;O Lord...enable me to \r\n        keep my heart and house open to receive thy servants that they may rest \r\n        in their travels that this house that thou has enabled me to build may \r\n        be holy dictates unto thee of the pilgrim's rest.&quot; Alston was the \r\n        treasurer of the Appoquinimink Meeting and was the weekly caretaker of \r\n        the building until his death in 1874. \r\n        <p></p><p><i>Appoquinimink Friends Meeting House is located on SR 299, \r\nwest of US 13 in Odessa, Delaware.

Among its many  court cases were the Hunn-Garrett Trials of 1848. Thomas Garrett(1789-1871), a  businessman, and John Hunn, (1818-1894) a minister, were Delaware's two most prominent Quaker abolitionists and activists on the Underground Railroad, channeling  freedom seekers from Delaware and Maryland to Philadelphia. Thomas Garrett was not secretive about his Underground Railroad work in the 1840s and 1850s, and was fearless in standing up to slave catchers. He kept a list of those he assisted - by his own reckoning 2500 -- and periodically reported the count at meetings  of abolition societies in Delaware and Pennsylvania. His letters regarding the  transfer of this human \"cargo\" were kept by William Still, the African American  secretary of the Philadelphia Abolition Society, and several were published in  Still's book <u>The Underground Railroad</u> in 1872. </p>\r\n <p align=\"left\">The downfall of Hunn and Garrett came in  1845. In November Samuel D. Burris, an educated free African American from  Philadelphia, led Samuel Hawkins, a freeman from Queen Anne's County, Maryland,  his enslaved wife, Emeline, and their enslaved children out of Maryland.  In December they arrived at the Middletown,  Delaware, farm of John Hunn who aided Burris and the runaways. Unfortunately the  pursuers tracked the runaways to Hunn's farm. The pursuers convinced the  sheriff to hold the family in the New Castle jail illegally until proper papers  were prepared. Garrett heard the news, met with the family, and arranged for an  attorney to present a Writ of Habeas Corpus. The judge accepted a copy of a  will manumitting Emeline, found no evidence of slave status, and freed the  family to continue their journey to Byberry Township, Pennsylvania, where they  settled.</p>\r\n <p align=\"left\">This assistance by  Thomas Garrett and John Hunn led to a well-publicized Federal trial. Garrett and Hunn were prosecuted under the  Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 which made it a Federal crime to assist, aid and/or  harbor a &quot;fugitive from servitude.&quot; They were found guilty by a jury consisting mostly of Sussex County slaveholders. The decision by presiding  Judge Robert B. Taney of the US Supreme Court, set a precedent by stating that  the fine of $500 under the Fugitive Slave Act applied to each fugitive harbored  or assisted, rather than a blanket fine. The judgement for damages caused Hunn to  lose his farm and Garrett to lose his home and business in Wilmington.  Although bankrupted, Garrett remained defiant.  After the sentencing, Garrett gave an impassioned speech to the courtroom, stating  he had no regrets: \".... And had I believed everyone one of them to be slaves, I should have done the same thing... I should have done violence to my convictions  of duty, had I not made use of all the lawful means in my power to liberate  those people and assist them to be men and women, rather than leave them in the  condition of chattels....\"  Thomas Garrett and John Hunn dedicated the  rest of their lives to assisting those escaping slavery, and, after the Civil  War, to those newly freed from bondage. </p>\r\n <p align=\"left\"><em>The New Castle County  Courthouse is located at </em><em>211  Delaware Street, New Castle, Delaware.

At the request\r\nof his second wife, Helen Pitts Douglass, Congress chartered the Frederick Douglass Memorial\r\nand Historical Association, to whom Mrs. Douglass bequeathed the house.  Joining with the\r\nNational Association of Colored Women's Clubs, the association opened the house to visitors in\r\n1916.  The property was added to the National Park system on September 5, 1962 and was\r\ndesignated a National Historic Site in 1988.\r\n\r\n<p>Douglass was born a slave on Maryland's Eastern Shore and was given the name Frederick\r\nAugustus Washington Bailey.  At an early age, he learned to read and write, and escaped to\r\nfreedom in the North, changing his name to Douglass to avoid recapture.  Eventually he settled in\r\nRochester, New York, and was active in the abolitionist cause.  He was a leader of\r\nRochester's Underground Railroad movement and became the editor and publisher of the\r\n<i>North Star</i>, an abolitionist newspaper.  After the Civil War, Douglass came to\r\nWashington, DC, and served as the marshall of the District of Columbia and was appointed\r\nrecorder of deeds for the city.  In 1889, President Harrison appointed him minister-resident and\r\nconsul general of the Republic of Haiti and charge d'affaires for the Dominican Republic.

Cary was one of the most outspoken \r\n          and articulate female proponents of the abolition of slavery of her \r\n          day, and promoted equality for all people. Mary Ann Shadd was born in \r\n          Wilmington, Delaware in October of 1823. The oldest of 13 children, \r\n          Mary was raised in a family dedicated to the abolition of slavery and \r\n          her childhood home often served as a shelter for fugitive slaves. As \r\n          the education of blacks was forbidden in Delaware, the Shadds moved \r\n          to Pennsylvania in 1833 where Mary began attended a Quaker Boarding \r\n          School until 1839. For the next 12 years, Mary taught black children \r\n          in Delaware, New York and Pennsylvania. </div>\r\n        <p>In 1850 with the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law, Mary Shadd and \r\n          her brother Isaac emigrated from the United States to Canada along with \r\n          scores of other African Americans who believed Canada offered better \r\n          and greater opportunities. While there, Mary published a pamphlet titled \r\n          &quot;Notes on Canada West&quot; that was widely circulated in the United \r\n          States, in which she extolled the values, benefits and opportunities \r\n          favorable to blacks in the region. In 1853, Mary founded Canada's first-antislavery \r\n          newspaper, the <i>Provincial Freeman</i>. This weekly publication encouraged \r\n          blacks to emigrate to Canada. Cary lectured widely in Canada and the \r\n          United States to increase subscription and to publicly solicit aid for \r\n          runaway slaves, at great risk to her own personal welfare. The dynamic \r\n          young female editor was known as &quot;The Rebel&quot; to her family \r\n          and friends. \r\n        <p>In 1856, Mary Shadd married a Toronto barber, Thomas F. Cary, who was \r\n          involved with the paper. Little is known of her married years, however, \r\n          she continued to befriend fugitive slaves and edit the <i>Provincial \r\n          Freeman</i>. In 1858, <a href=\"md1.htm\">John Brown </a>held a secret \r\n          &quot;convention&quot; at the home of Mary's brother Issac, a meeting \r\n          that elevated Mary's concern for the anti-slavery cause. In 1861, she \r\n          published <i>Voice from Harper's Ferry</i>, a tribute to Brown's unsuccessful \r\n          raid. During the Civil War, Mary Shadd Cary was appointed a Recruiting \r\n          Officer for the Union Army. Widowed sometime during the war, Mary later \r\n          moved to Washington, DC, where she taught \r\n          at public schools. She continued \r\n          to lecture, focusing on women's rights and the women's suffrage \r\n          movement. She studied law at Howard University and graduated in June \r\n          1883. Little is known of her legal practice, but she is recognized as \r\n          one of the first black female lawyers in the country. Mary Ann Shadd \r\n          Cary died in 1893. Though not directly associated with Cary's involvement \r\n          in the Underground Railroad, her home helps us to better understand \r\n          her participation in the movement and her lifelong advocacy for the \r\n          equality of all people. \r\n        <p> <i> The Mary Ann Shadd Cary House is located at 1421 W Street, NW \r\n          in Washington, DC.

The Riley farm where the house stood was where Henson lived  and worked while enslaved from 1795 to 1830. The existing building is the ca.  1800 Chesapeake Tidewater-style frame domestic dwelling with a ca. 1850 log  kitchen wing. Henson chronicled his journey from slavery to freedom in his  autobiography, <em>The Life of Josiah Henson, </em>published in 1849, after his journey to Canada on the Underground Railroad.  He named his slave 'master' Isaac Riley, and identified the location of the farm  as five miles outside Rockville. The bulk of Henson's narrative revolves around  his life on the Riley land and the turbulent relationship with his master,  described as a \"<em>grim oppressor</em>.\" Riley  owned at least 20 bondsmen then. </p>\r\n <p>Henson's words describe interactions  with his owner in the main block of this house during the 30 years Henson  toiled the land, and negotiated sale of goods on Riley's behalf as the farm  superintendent. In 1825 he led a contingent of fellow bondsmen to the  plantation of his master's brother Amos in Davies County, Kentucky, despite the  temptation of passing where escape was possible. When Henson returned to Rockville in about 1828, Isaac Riley retrieved the pass that ensured Henson's safe travel  to and from Kentucky. When Matilda Riley stored this document away in her husband's desk, Henson was there and he recalled, \"<em>I heard the old prison-gate clang</em>.\" Shortly thereafter, Isaac  Riley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brother-in-law persuaded Riley to manumit Henson and his family in 1829.  Upon his arrival in Kentucky to gather his family, Henson learned from his wife  that he had been tricked out of his rightful emancipation by Riley who then  nearly doubled the price of Henson's freedom. </p>\r\n <p>Giving up on legal means, Henson  shed his enslaved status by self-emancipation. Persuading his wife and small  children that the long journey to Canada was critical to their survival as a  family was no easy feat, as his wife Charlotte knew the dangers that lay ahead.  With her consent, the Henson family left the Amos Riley plantation in  mid-September and moved through Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, and New York before  arriving in Canada in October 1830.</p>\r\n <p>In Canada, Henson was a leader of  the fugitive slave colony Dawn near the Detroit River and an Underground  Railroad conductor. He became a speaker and writer, and his narrative received  worldwide praise and readership. By 1877, <em>The  Life of Josiah Henson </em>had sold over a quarter of a million copies. As  interpreted through Stowe's book, it helped facilitate a growing abolition  movement in the United States.

According to Stowe, Bruin's \r\ndaughter begged that Mary and Emily Edmondson be excluded from the group that \r\nwas eventually sent to New Orleans for sale there, a group that included other \r\nEdmondson siblings. Their father, Paul Edmondson, traveled north to try and raise \r\nfunds for the purchase of two of his daughters. He eventually met Reverand Lyman \r\nBeecher, Stowe's father, who raised the sum overnigt. Bruin and his &quot;large \r\nslave warehouse&quot; are mentioned approximately 20 times in the <I>The Key</I>. \r\nAt the outbreak of the Civil War, Bruin fled Alexandria but was captured and then \r\nconfined in the Old Captiol Prison in Washington, DC, until the end of the war. \r\nIn his absense, his slave jail was used as the Fairfax County courthouse until \r\nJuly of 1865.</P><p> <i> Bruin's Slave Jail is located at 1707 Duke St., in Alexandria, \r\nVirginia.

As the continuously held Union stronghold to the Confederate capital of Richmond, Fort Monroe played an important role in the conduct of the war in the Eastern Theater and along the Atlantic coast. Fort Monroe, a Third System fortification built between 1819 and 1834, is located in Hampton, Virginia. The site, approximately 565 acres of ground, includes the 63-acre fortress and is both a National Historic Landmark District and a National Monument. Built as the first permanent set of quarters at Fort Monroe in 1819, Quarters One is a large three-story, central block, doublepile residence with flanking, two-story wings. Quarters One is the site of the May 1861 contraband decision by General Benjamin F. Butler.  </p>\r\n<p>Enslaved workers of Confederate Colonel Charles Mallory were contracted out to work on nearby Confederate fortifications. On May 23, they sought refuge at Fort Monroe. Butler refused to return them to their owner as stipulated in the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act and declared them confiscated property or \"Contraband of War.\" In August of 1861, Congress passed the Confiscation Act providing a de facto ratification of Butler's action. News of this decision spread rapidly throughout the enslaved community and thousands successfully made their way to Fort Monroe where they labored in the defensive preparations in and around the fort. The American Missionary Association was the first Northern organization to aid the contraband. Upon arriving at Fort Monroe in 1861 and thinking of freedom for all and the future role of African Americans, Lewis Lockwood, one of its members, wrote, \"On the contraband, under God, perhaps hinges the destiny of this Republic.\" By the time the War ended in 1865, over 10,000 African Americans had sought refuge at Fort Monroe. Butler's contraband decision placed Fort Monroe as a major starting point on the pathway to the freedom codified in Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation. In 1863, a reading of President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation to the contrabands and free blacks proclaimed that the bondsmen who had made their way to Fort Monroe were thereby free forever.  </p>\r\n<p><em>The park is located approximately 65 miles from Richmond, Virginia, at the tip of the Virginia Peninsula.

The house is a well-preserved example of Federal-style architecture and sits on the banks of the Rappahannock River in  Stafford County, Virginia.  The site was  the family home of author, clergyman, and abolitionist, Moncure Daniel Conway. The significance of the site to the  Underground Railroad is its association with Moncure Conway (1832-1907) and  thirty enslaved African Americans belonging to his family whom he helped to  escape to freedom by accompanying them on their journey to Ohio. In his  autobiography he recounts the escape and identifies one of the refugees as his  nurse Maria.</p>\r\n <p>In 1838, Conway  House was the home of Margaret Daniel and Walker Peyton Conway, an elite family  with enslaved laborers.  Walker Peyton  Conway was a state legislator and a magistrate. Theirs was a family split by the Civil War. Two sons fought in the Confederacy but Moncure's mother and  sister spent much of the war in Pennsylvania where the sister's husband taught.<br>\r\n   Among the five  children, Moncure Daniel Conway came to feel that slavery was wrong.  He attended the Methodist-sponsored Dickinson  College in Pennsylvania and then studied law back in Virginia. After becoming a  Methodist minister in Maryland, he was attracted to Unitarianism. Supported by other abolitionists, he graduated from Harvard  Divinity School. In Boston he met an intellectual idol, Ralph Waldo Emerson. When  he pastored churches in Washington, D.C., and Cincinnati, his anti-slavery  sermons resulted in controversy. After leaving Washington, he found the Ohio  congregation, however, more liberal and he was able to write and study.<br>\r\n   Conway  had no freedom as long as others were enslaved.  He satisfied his sincere desire to help others achieve their personal  rights and liberties in July 1862 when he came upon the gathering of over 30  enslaved people from his parents' home, who had found their way to  Georgetown.\u00c2\u00a0 After making arrangements  for military permission for transit and buying tickets, Conway led and  accompanied them on a harrowing train ride through slave-holding Maryland to freedom and resettlement in Yellow Springs, Ohio. Today the descendants of  families are known as the \"Conway Colony.\" </p>\r\n <p><em>The Moncure Conway House is located at  305 King Street, Falmouth, VA.

It is wooded with several archaeological sites in addition to the monument. The Potomac River flows into two channels surrounding the island. It is the site of both a camp for refugees from slavery and Camp Greene, a camp for African American troops partly recruited from freedom seekers.  </p>\r\n<p>In 1861, many escaped bondsmen began pouring into Union lines, placing great strain on the fabric of nearby cities.  In the District of Columbia, the population influx of both fleeing bondsmen and newly freed blacks created an immediate need for food, shelter, clothing, and medical care.  The refugees from slavery came to be known as \"contrabands\" because they were not returned to slavery on the legal basis that they were seized \"property\" of the Confederates. The government established  \"contraband\" camps to address their needs. The able-bodied found work with the government, though sheer numbers soon overwhelmed the camps. Freedman's Village, established on the Arlington Estate, soon became so overcrowded that a new \"employment depot\" was built on Mason's Island, which then in turn became so overcrowded and disease-ridden that reforms were necessary.  </p>\r\n<p>On New Year's Day, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, which not only freed bondsmen in rebellious states, but also opened the door for formal enlistment of African American troops in the army. The First Regiment, one of the first formally established African American units, was recruited mainly in the District of Columbia, from both free African Americans and freedom seekers. For example, in order to enlist, John Chen escaped slavery in Caroline County and Henry Bailey slavery in Suffolk, Virginia. The army's Camp Greene was created on the island, in addition to the camp for contrabands. Camp Greene was an encampment for the First Regiment of United States Colored Troops between May to September 1863. It was so located partly to protect the soldiers from harassment in the city. Among others, the poet Walt Whitman came to visit the troops. </p>\r\n<p><em>Theodore  Roosevelt Island is located in the Potomac River off the George Washington  Memorial Parkway near Rosslyn, Virginia.

Brown had attempted to lead a slave rebellion and establish a free black stonghold in the Appalachians.  The trial drew great attention, especially from northern sympathizers who campaigned for his acquittal. Attempting to evade trial by claiming illness, Brown was pronounced competent to stand trial by a physician, but was allowed to lie on a cot to deliver his testimony. Brown's illness, however, did nothing to sway the court and he was found guilty of conspiring with slaves to rebel, of murder and of treason against Virginia.  Sentenced to death, Brown was hanged near the courthouse and his body was removed by train to <a href=\"ny4.htm\">his farm in upstate New York</a>.

His plan was to liberate slaves by starting a revolution, arming the slaves, and establishing a free black stronghold in the Appalachians.  Brown chose Harpers Ferry because of the stock of weapons at the Federal armory there and its location near the mountains. On the night of October 16, he set out for Harpers Ferry with 17 men and a wagonload of supplies.  The party crossed the Potomac River, seizing the bridge and armory watchmen.  Brown then cut telegraph wires and sent parties out to bring in slaves and hostages.\r\n      <p>\r\n\r\nBrown's men barricaded themselves in armory buildings and began to exchange fire with townspeople.  By noon of October 17, the militia had arrived and secured the Potomac River bridge.  The raiders who survived the encounter with the militia managed to take refuge in the fire engine house of the armory's musket factory, where they were stormed by a party of marines on the morning of October 18.  Two men were bayoneted and others were captured, including John Brown who was brought to trial the following week in the <a href=\"wv1.htm\">county seat of Charles Town</a>.<p>\r\n\r\n<i>The<a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/hafe/home.htm\">Harpers Ferry National Historical Park</a> is located at the confluence of  the Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers in the states of West Virginia, Virginia, and Maryland, 65 miles northwest of Washington, DC, and 20 miles southwest of Frederick, MD, via U.S. Route 340.

Located in northwest Florida's Franklin County, approximately 15 miles from the mouth of the Apalachicola River, British Fort is a symbol of the strong relationship between runaway slaves and the Seminole Indians.  During\r\nthe late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, slaves from the Carolinas and Georgia escaped\r\nto northern Florida, at that time under Spanish control, and sought and received refuge from the\r\nSeminole Indians.  In return, the runaway slaves would cultivate crops, paying one-third of their\r\nproduce to the Indians. Seminoles welcomed the development of black communities alongside\r\ntheir villages.  Knowledgeable in the white man's languages of English, French, and Spanish, the\r\nfugitive slaves often acted as interpreters and intelligence agents for the Seminole community.  \r\n\r\n<p>In the summer and fall of 1814, near the conclusion of the War of 1812, British Major Edward\r\nNicholls led an expedition to recruit Seminoles and blacks to assist the British fight against\r\nAmerica.  British soldiers and the black and Indian recruits constructed a fort 500 feet\r\nfrom the river bank on Prospect Bluff, which they called British Post.  Consisting of an octagonal\r\nearthwork holding the principal magazine and surrounded by an extensive rectangular enclosure\r\ncovering about seven acres with bastions on the eastern corners having parapets 15 feet high and\r\n18 feet thick, the fort was used as the British headquarters for negotiations between the black and\r\nIndian communities.  In 1815 when the British withdrew from the area, the fort, including its\r\nartillery and military supplies, were given to the many blacks and a few Indians that had moved\r\ninto it, seeking the protection it offered and cultivating successful and profitable plantations\r\naround it. The fort became known as \"Negro Fort\" and it served as a \"beacon of light to restless\r\nand rebellious slaves.\"  In 1816, the American army, under the command of Major General\r\nAndrew Jackson, constructed Fort Scott on the Flint River a few miles from Florida to protect the\r\nAmerican border between Georgia and Florida and to destroy Negro Fort, which was perceived\r\nas a threat to white slaveholders in Georgia.  In July of that year, Jackson gave the order to\r\ndestroy Negro fort and to return the blacks to their white owners.    In the insuing warfare, an\r\nAmerican shell hit an open magazine within the fort, killing approximately 300 men, women,\r\nand children.  The few survivors were taken prisoner and turned over to Georgia slaveholders\r\nwho justified their title to them by saying that their ancestors had owned the ancestors of the\r\nprisoners.  This \"savage and negro war,\" as Andrew Jackson himself called it, was devised to\r\ndestroy black towns in Florida, depriving slaves of bordering states of a refuge, while at the same\r\ntime bringing the entire Florida province under American rule.  In 1818, Jackson ordered\r\nLieutenant James Gadsden to build a new fort (which became known as Fort Gadsden) upon the\r\nsite of the old Negro Fort, due to its strategic location on Apalachicola River.  American forces were\r\ngarrisoned there until Florida ceded to the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n <P>\r\n<I> British Fort, or Fort Gadsden, is located in the <a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r8/florida/apalachicola/\">Apalachicola National Forest</a> and is a short distance from State Road 65, near Sumatra, Florida.

Ford, a pivotal black leader in the early history of Colorado. Ford \r\nwas a black pioneer, businessman, civic leader and politician who actively fought \r\nfor African American civil rights in his state. Born January 22, 1822 in Stafford, \r\nVirginia, Ford grew up as a slave on a South Carolina plantation but escaped to \r\nChicago. He became active in the abolition movement while in Chicago after meeting \r\nHenry O. Wagoner, an active member of the Underground Railroad. Ford later married \r\nWagoner's sister-in-law Julia. \r\n<P>The Fords moved to Colorado, purchased \r\nland on Blake Street in Denver and built a small building there only to have it \r\ndestroyed by fire the following year. He rebuilt the current brick building in \r\nwhich was located a restaurant, bar, barber shop and hair salon. From this initial \r\nbusiness venture, Ford expanded his commercial holdings steadily. By 1854, Ford \r\nwas generating the 14th highest income in the state of Colorado, the result of \r\nhis numerous income-producing properties, including hotels in Denver and Cheyenne, \r\nWyoming. Ford played a significant role in the admission of Colorado to the Union \r\nas a free state. A member of the Republican party, Ford was the first African \r\nAmerican to be nominated to the Territorial Legislature. In 1865, Ford successfully \r\nlobbied the Federal government for black voting rights in Colorado, enlisting \r\nthe support of Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts.</P><p> <i> The Barney \r\nL.
